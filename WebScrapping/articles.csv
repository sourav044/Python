"IPL 2020, RR vs MI: Ben Stokes, Sanju Samson star as Rajasthan Royals beat Mumbai Indians by 8 wickets",,Rajasthan did not start well with the bat as they lost Uthappa early and Smith did not last long as well. There would have been alarm bells ringing as Stokes was not in good form coming into this game just like Samson but they proved everyone wrong as Stokes was magnificent as he reached his century and took Rajasthan home. It was just mesmerizing to watch as he took the bowlers apart. This is the Stokes that we all have come to know and Rajasthan would hope that he continues to perform like this in their upcoming games. The thing that would have pleased them would have been Sanju Samson. He gave himself time at the start and then found the boundaries at will. He gave able support to Stokes and they ended up on the winning side. Very rarely do you see such a big score chased down by Rajasthan without Jos Buttler being in the thick of things.

Coronavirus symptoms and precautions: All you need to know,,"What is coronavirus?

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?

Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?

Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?

It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said. What is the treatment for novel coronavirus?

There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately.

Here is a list of dos and don'ts issued by the government to stall the spread of the virus in the country —

Do's

Cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissue or handkerchief

Frequently wash your hands with soap and water

Avoid crowded places

Person suffering from Influenza like illness must be confined at home

Stay more than one arm's length distance from persons sick with flu

Take adequate sleep and rest

Drink plenty of water/liquids and eat nutritious food

Person suspected with Influenza like illness must consult doctor

Don'ts

Touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands while coughing or sneezing

Hugging, kissing and shaking hands while greeting

Spitting in public places

Taking medicines without consulting doctor

Disposal of used napkin or tissue paper in open areas

Touching surfaces usually used by public (railing, door, gates, etc)

NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases."
India News - Times of India,,"PM Modi assures to fight climate change, says India has one of lowest carbon emissions in world"
Coronavirus India live updates: Lockdown extended in containment zones till November 30,,"Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, said that it has been observed that states and union territories like Kerala, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi have reported rise in cases during the festival season.

He further added, ""It is mandatory for all of us to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the festival season."""
Coronavirus cases in India: Sharpest weekly drop in Covid numbers,,"Sixth straight week of decline in fresh Covid cases in India

NEW DELHI: In the steepest weekly fall yet in Covid-19 numbers in India, fresh infections recorded this week (October 19-25) were nearly 16% less than the previous week’s tally while deaths from the virus fell by 19% during this period.India recorded just over 3.6 lakh fresh cases during the week, the lowest in absolute terms in three months (since 3.2 lakh were detected in the July 20-26 week), as per data collated from state governments.This marked a drop of 15.7% from the previous week’s numbers, the sharpest weekly fall in cases since the pandemic hit India. Last week, nearly 4.3 lakh cases were recorded in the country.This was the sixth straight week of decline in fresh Covid-19 cases from the peak of 6,45,014 infections reported during September 7-13, indicating a sustained reduction in the pandemic’s spread in India.Meanwhile, India achieved another positive milestone when the number of recoveries crossed 90% of all cases on Sunday. Close to 71.3 lakh people have now recovered from the infection, out of a total caseload so far of 79.1 lakh, as per TOI’s database. Deaths from the virus were down 19% from last week’s toll. This week India recorded just over 4,400 fatalities due to Covid-19, as compared with 5,455 last week. Deaths too have been declining for five consecutive weeks since peaking at 8,175 during September 14-20.Last week (October 12-18) had seen a 13.3% fall in fresh cases and a 15.9% drop in fatalities, the highest weekly fall till then. The fall in daily cases continued, with 46,135 fresh infections recorded on Sunday. This was the lowest daily tally of cases (not counting Mondays when the numbers fall due to other reasons) in 95 days since 38,444 cases were reported on July 21. Sunday’s death toll, at 489, was also the lowest daily fatalities in 108 days since July 9.Numbers fell in almost all states on Sunday, which also coincided with festivals of Dussehra and Durga Puja. Delhi was an exception, recording 4,136 fresh cases, the highest in 38 days. This is despite the fact that there has been no drop in testing. Karnataka became the third state in the country to record 8 lakh Covid-19 cases. It reached the grim milestone with 4,439 fresh cases taking the total to 8,02,813 on Sunday. Gujarat added 919 new cases, taking the total to 1.67 lakh. The new cases in Gujarat included 227 from Surat, 174 from Ahmedabad, 115 from Vadodara, and 97 from Rajkot."
Coronavirus vaccine storage issues could leave 3 billion people without access,,"GAMPELA, BURKINA FASO: The chain breaks here, in a tiny medical clinic in Burkina Faso that went nearly a year without a working refrigerator.From factory to syringe, the world's most promising coronavirus vaccine candidates need non-stop sterile refrigeration to stay potent and safe. But despite enormous strides in equipping developing countries to maintain the vaccine ""cold chain,"" nearly 3 billion of the world's 7.8 billion people live where temperature-controlled storage is insufficient for an immunization campaign to bring Covid-19 under control.The result: Poor people around the world who were among the hardest hit by the virus pandemic are also likely to be the last to recover from it.The vaccine cold chain hurdle is just the latest disparity of the pandemic weighted against the poor, who more often live and work in crowded conditions that allow the virus to spread, have little access to medical oxygen that is vital to Covid-19 treatment, and whose health systems lack labs, supplies or technicians to carry out large-scale testing.Maintaining the cold chain for coronavirus vaccines won't be easy even in the richest of countries, especially when it comes to those that require ultracold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F). Investment in infrastructure and cooling technology lags behind the high-speed leap that vaccine development has taken this year due to the virus.With the pandemic now in its eighth month, logistics experts warn that vast parts of the world lack the refrigeration to administer an effective vaccination program. This includes most of Central Asia, much of India and southeast Asia, Latin America except for the largest countries, and all but a tiny corner of Africa.The medical clinic outside Burkina Faso's capital, a dirt-streaked building that serves a population of 11,000, is a microcosm of the obstacles.After its refrigerator broke last fall, the clinic could no longer keep vaccines against tetanus, yellow fever, tuberculosis and other common diseases on site, nurse Julienne Zoungrana said. Staff instead used motorbikes to fetch vials in insulated carriers from a hospital in Ouagadougou, making a 40-minute round-trip drive on a narrow road that varies between dirt, gravel and pavement.A mother of two who visits the Gampela clinic says she thinks a coronavirus inoculation program will be challenging in her part of the world. Adama Tapsoba, 24, walks four hours under scorching sun to get her baby his routine immunizations and often waits hours more to see a doctor. A week earlier, her 5-month-old son had missed a scheduled shot because Tapsoba's daughter was sick and she could only bring one child on foot.""It will be hard to get a (COIVD-19) vaccine,"" Tapsoba said, bouncing her 5-month-old son on her lap outside the clinic. ""People will have to wait at the hospital, and they might leave without getting it.""To uphold the cold chain in developing nations, international organizations have overseen the installation of tens of thousands of solar-powered vaccine refrigerators. Keeping vaccines at stable temperatures from the time they are made until they are given to patients also requires mobile refrigeration, reliable electricity, sound roads and, above all, advance planning.For poor countries like Burkina Faso, the best chance of receiving a coronavirus vaccine is through the Covax initiative, led by the World Health Organization and the Gavi vaccine alliance. The goal of Covax is to place orders for multiple promising vaccine candidates and to allocate the successful ones equitably.The United Nations' children's agency, UNICEF, began laying the global distribution groundwork months ago, in Copenhagen. At the world's largest humanitarian aid warehouse, logistics staff are trying to foresee shortages by learning from the past, especially the spring chaos surrounding global shortages of masks and other protective gear that were commandeered off airport tarmacs or stolen and traded on the black market.Currently, 42 coronavirus vaccine candidates are in clinical trials and another 151 are in pre-clinical evaluation, according to WHO. The ones most likely to end up in the Covax mix must be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (25-46 F).A Pfizer candidate is among the ones in advanced testing requiring storage at ultracold temperatures. The company, which has designed a special carrying case for its vaccine, has expressed interest in Covax and signed contracts with the United States, Europe and Japan.Medical freezers that go down to minus 70 degrees Celsius are rare even in US and European hospitals. Many experts believe the West African countries that suffered through a 2014-16 Ebola outbreak may be the best positioned, because a vaccine against that virus also requires ultracold storage.For more than two-thirds of the world, however, the advanced technology is nowhere on the horizon, according to a study by German logistics company DHL. Meanwhile, billions of people are in countries that don't have the necessary infrastructure to maintain the cold chain for either existing vaccines or more conventional coronavirus candidates, the study said.Opportunities for vaccines to be lost expand the farther a vaccine travels. DHL estimated that 15,000 cargo flights would be required to vaccinate the entire planet against Covid-19, stretching global capacity for aircraft and potentially supplies of materials such as dry ice.""We need to find a bridge"" for every gap in the cold chain, DHL chief commercial officer Katja Busch said. ""We're talking about investments ... as a society, this is something we have to do.""Gavi and UNICEF worked before the pandemic to supply much of Africa and Asia with refrigeration for vaccines, fitting out 40,000 facilities since 2017. UNICEF is now offering governments a checklist of what they will need to maintain a vaccine supply chain and asking them to develop a plan.""The governments are in charge of what needs to happen in the end,"" said Benjamin Schreiber, who is among the directors of UNICEF's vaccination program.Cracks in the global cold chain start once vaccines leave the factory. Container ships are not equipped to refrigerate pharmaceutical products with a limited shelf life. Shipping vaccines by air costs a lot more, and air cargo traffic is only now rebounding from pandemic-related border closures.Even when flights are cold and frequent enough, air freight carries other potential hazards. WHO estimates that as much as half of vaccines globally are lost to wastage, sometimes due to heat exposure or vials breaking while in transit. With coronavirus vaccines, which will be one of the world's most sought-after products, theft is also a danger.""They can't be left on a tarmac and fought over because they would actually be spoiled and they would have no value, or worse still, people would still be trying to distribute them,"" said Glyn Hughes, the global head of cargo for the International Air Transport Association.Tinglong Dai, a Johns Hopkins University researcher who specializes in health care logistics, said creativity will be needed to keep the cold chain intact while coronavirus vaccines are distributed on a global scale. Gavi and UNICEF have experimented with delivering vaccines by drone. Indian officials have floated the idea of setting aside part of the country's vast food storage network for the coronavirus vaccines.""If people can figure out how to transport ice cream, they can transport vaccines,"" Dai said.Temperature-sensitive labels that change color when a vaccine is exposed to heat too long and no longer safe to use, and live delivery tracking to ensure vaccines reach their destinations as intended also have allowed for progress in delivering safe shots.Yet chances for something to go wrong multiply on the ground as vaccines are prepped to leave national depots. Since the cold chain is so fragile, logistics planning is crucial; syringes and disposal boxes must be available as soon as vaccine shipments arrive.By the end of the year, UNICEF expects to have 520 million syringes pre-positioned for coronavirus vaccines in the developing world and maps of where the refrigeration needs are greatest ""to ensure that these supplies arrive in countries by the time the vaccines do,"" Executive Director Henrietta Fore said.The last vaccine requiring cold storage that India's national program adopted was for rotavirus, a stomach bug that typically affects babies and young children. Dr Gagandeep Kang, who led the research for that vaccine, estimated that India has about 30% less storage capacity than it would need for a coronavirus vaccine.In countries such as India and Burkina Faso, a lack of public transportation presents another obstacle to getting citizens inoculated before vaccines go bad.Dr. Aquinas Edassery, who runs two clinics in one of India's poorest and least developed regions, said patients must walk for hours to receive health care. The trip on a single road that winds 86 kilometers (53 miles) over steep hills and washes out for months at a time will pose an insurmountable barrier for many residents of the eastern district of Rayagada, Edassery said.As with most logistics, the last kilometer (mile) is the hardest part of delivering a coronavirus vaccine to the people who need it. In Latin America, perhaps nowhere more than Venezuela provides a glimpse into how the vaccine cold chain could go dramatically off course.When a blackout last year left much of the nation in the dark for a week, doctors in several parts of Venezuela reported losing stocks of vaccines. The country's largest children's hospital had to discard thousands of doses of vaccines for illnesses like diphtheria, according to Dr. Huniades Urbina, head of the Venezuelan Society of Childcare and Pediatrics.""We won't be able to halt either the coronavirus or measles,"" Urbina said.Preserving the cold chain has only grown more difficult since then. Gas shortages limit the ability to move vaccines quickly from one part of Venezuela to another. Dry ice to keep vaccines cool during transport is harder to find. And after years of economic decline, there also are fewer doctors and other professionals trained to keep the chain intact.""I'm not optimistic on how the vaccine would be distributed in the inner states because there is no infrastructure of any kind to guarantee delivery — or if it gets delivered, guarantees the adequate preservation under cold conditions,"" Dr Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a Venezuelan pathologist, said.Venezuela presents an extreme example, but a coronavirus vaccine also is likely to test parts of Latin America with more robust health care systems. In Peru, private businesses that typically transport fish and beef have offered their trucks, though it remains unclear whether the Health Ministry will accept.Back in Burkina Faso, vaccination days became an ordeal at the Gampela clinic when the refrigerator went out, said Zoungrana, the nurse. Staff members on hospital courier runs must buy fuel they often can't afford and make a second trip to and from the capital to return any unused doses.""We're suffering,"" said Zoungrana, who was run off the road on her motorbike just a few weeks ago.Days after journalists from The Associated Press visited the clinic this month, a long-awaited solar refrigerator arrived. With technicians in short supply, the clinic was waiting to be sure the appliance would function properly before stocking it with vaccines.Nationwide, Burkina Faso is about 1,000 clinical refrigerators short, and less than 40% of the health facilities that conduct vaccinations have reliable fridges, national vaccination director Issa Ouedraogo said.Multi-dose vials — the equivalent of bulk storage for vaccines — can drastically reduce global transportation costs. But once a vial is opened, its shelf life counts down even faster; if too few people show up for their jabs in time, whatever remains in the larger vials must be discarded.""It's really upsetting to have wastage like that. It'll result in loss of lives and pain and suffering. It's a waste of resources, "" said University of Massachusetts at Amherst professor Anna Nagurney, who studies supply chain logistics.For now, UNICEF is betting on 20-dose vials of coronavirus vaccine and hoping that the amount wasted will stay below 3% for closed vials and 15% for open multi-dose vials that do not get used up, according to Michelle Siedel, one of the UN agency's cold chain experts.If Burkina Faso were given 1 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine today, the country wouldn't be able to handle it, Jean-Claude Mubalama, UNICEF's head of health and nutrition for the African nation.""If we had to vaccinate against the coronavirus now, at this moment, it would be impossible,"" he said."

A fixed deposit is a form of investment method offered by banks and several non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). In a fixed deposit, you deposit a certain amount of money for a fixed time period during which this money earns interest. Fixed deposit is a tried and tested way to increase your savings, as it gives a higher rate of interest than savings accounts. In addition to this, FDs are considered to be one of the safest investment options, as they are independent of market fluctuations, and returns on them are assured."
"India squad for Australia tour 2020: Rohit Sharma out of Australia tour with hamstring injury; Siraj in Test squad, Varun in T20Is",,"The Squads:

Team India T20I squad:

Team India ODI squad:

Team India Test squad:

NEW DELHI: India's limited-over vice-captain and senior opener Rohit Sharma was on Monday left out of all three squads for the tour of Australia due to a recurring hamstring injury which is set to oust him from the remainder of the Indian Premier League as well.In Rohit's absence, the in-form KL Rahul will be Virat Kohli 's deputy in the white ball teams and is also back in the Test squad after a considerable period of time. Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant failed to make the cut for the limited overs even though he retained his place in the Test squad.""The BCCI Medical Team will continue to monitor the progress of Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma ,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a press release announcing the squads.The tour of Australia comprises three T20 Internationals, as many ODIs and four Tests. It is set to get underway from November 27.It is learnt that in case of Rohit, it might take a good six to eight weeks for complete recovery from the injury that he picked up during the IPL.""It is unlikely that Rohit will take any further part in this year's Indian Premier League. He will have to go back to India and be at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for the rehabilitation,"" a senior BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The story of Monday's selection was undoubtedly Rahul, who is also now India's first-choice keeper in both T20 Internationals and ODIs as selectors finally ran out of patience with Pant.""Rahul is being looked as India's first choice white-ball keeper till the 2021 World T20 and beyond. Also he has impressed everyone with his leadership skills and that's why this elevation as vice-captain,"" the source said.Sanju Samson will be the second wicket-keeper in T20 International squad which also features Kolkata Knight Riders' mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy .Among other notable inclusions, pacer Mohammed Siraj has been rewarded with a Test call-up for his consistent red-ball performances. The absence of the injured duo of Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar also paved the way for his selection.""Siraj and (Navdeep) Saini were automatic choices in the Test team once Bhuvi (thigh muscle) and Ishant (Left rib cage) were ruled out,"" the source said.It is understood that Pant's dodgy fitness and tendency to put on weight has not gone down well with Sunil Joshi-led selection committee, which wanted him to be served a wake-up call.""In any case, all three teams will be there, Pant, if need be, can be added to the squad,"" the source added.It is undoubtedly a big day for the 29-year-old Chennai-based architect Varun, who has played 21 representative matches at the senior level, including 11 T20 games -- all at the IPL.His five-wicket haul against Delhi Capitals is one of the highlights of this IPL and he has bowled brilliantly at the death mixing his clever variations.With Kuldeep Yadav not being preferred by his own franchise for the better part, it is Varun, who has stolen the limelight.The tour will also prove to be a good exposure for T Natarajan, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kartik Tyagi and Ishan Porel.""Ishan will primarily be a red ball net bowler while Natarajan provides the left-arm variation training for white ball. Kartik Tyagi bowls good yorkers and Kamlesh has pace. In case, any main team bowler gets injured, one of the four can be easily drafted in,"" the source said.Virat Kohli (Captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (vice-captain and wicket-keeper), Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya, Sanju Samson (wicket-keeper), Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

You simply have to be extra careful and stay in close touch with your doctor. If you are trying to get pregnant naturally from the past six months or more and have been unsuccessful, it is best to see a fertility specialist. A fertility specialist will run a few tests to evaluate the factors affecting your ability to get pregnant. As per the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), most women cannot get naturally pregnant after the age of 45 years.

What it is like to be in a sexless marriage,,"Sex is erotic, exciting, alluring and all things fine. This natural human need has brought people closer and initiated closer intimacy among strained relationships. You get that beautiful feeling at any time in the day and indulge in amazing sex sessions with your partner. Whether you’re in a casual relationship or serious one, sex is your go-to peace. Even when love goes awry, sex undeniably binds together the relationship.Hence, we bring to you a woman’s account of being in a sexless marriage.It’s been six years since we got married. Life’s been blissful and I’ve never been thankful. I have a beautiful family and two twins who make every second worthwhile. My husband and I met when we were working and our marriage has been a successful one. We used to go out on dates, candlelight dinners (so cheesy!) and he even used to give flowers. Sex was amazing and we never got enough of each other. Until a year after having kids.I’ve been blessed with two beautiful daughters but I feel like we’ve stopped having sex at all, ever since I had our children. At first, it seemed natural because pregnancy completely alters your body. I stopped having any desires and mostly because both of us rarely got any sleep! But with time as well, I noticed that my husband didn’t feel attracted to me anymore.It was heartbreaking. Since it was a love marriage, both of us were very familiar with our emotional and sexual preferences. It was great before, but it left me quite puzzled as to why my husband didn’t want sex any more. Our communication was getting weaker and it left me frustrated whenever I was alone in my room, thinking.I wonder what is the reason behind this. My work hours or me, myself? Don’t get me wrong, I love my body and I'm proud of it, but this is equally sad. I’ve even struggled to come into terms with realising and wanting sex openly with my husband.I slowly realised that he didn’t deter emotionally, that means he still loves me. That’s a relief. But the, why doesn’t he want sex?After practising countless times on how to approach the discussion, I went straight ahead and had a talk with my husband. Turns out, he gets really tired after work and isn’t really in a mood to have sex. He even further said that his work keeps him so occupied that he hardly has time to think at all. He then brushed off the topic with a smile and kissed me.I felt content but then, couldn’t stop thinking about it. He does have time because he spends sufficient time with our kids and on days when our kids are with their grandparents, we go out to have dinner. That’s great but we come home and fall asleep. Me? Unwillingly.I was determined to approach the topic once more. After all, sex is just as important, right? Marriages are built on love, trust, understanding and definitely sex and so, my husband finally came around. He said, he just didn’t see me the same as he did before my pregnancy. I was left dumbfounded. I felt tears sogging up my eyes. The thought that my after-pregnancy body would be the reason never crossed my mind. He quickly corrected that he loved my body and the marks our children left. But what he couldn’t come into terms was that he couldn’t have sex with the woman who bore his children. I watched him quietly as he struggled to express and elaborate on the reason.My husband loved my body but couldn’t have sex with the woman who birthed his kids. What kind of a reason was that?I understood that I should just let the matter go for now because we both needed time to process our thoughts and feelings. Long before I was surfing the internet for answers, I came across a couple’s sex therapy online. Therapy seemed scary because if we attended, it meant our marriage was a problem. The truth was harsh.Surprisingly, my husband was eager to attend the therapy, provided it was online. We paid for our first session in the beginning, and let me tell you, we are slowly working it out. I didn’t understand what my husband’s problem was, but our therapist made me understand better. So for now, we are working it out. Therapy has been good and I feel there’s an improvement. We still haven’t got to sex but I feel like we are edging forward to it now."

A popular American beauty blogger is breaking the internet for a rather unique experiment. Chicago-based model and beauty blogger, Brianah Christianson shared a video on a social media app that has her applying mehendi (read henna ) as a lip stain. Well, that was enough for the desi crowd to troll the blogger.The video, that was also shared on Twitter has Brianah using a good old henna cone, the one Indian girls use on their Mehendi day. The video shows the blogger applying henna (straight out of a cone) on her lips with a brush. She applies the mehendi to stain her lips and calls it her ""Henna Lip Stain.""""You have seen henna freckles. How about henna lips? I chose the red henna for my lips. I just wanted a natural, subtle red sheen. I began by filling in my lip line, and slowly kept building from the corner to the insides. I gave it one hour to set,"" Brianah says in the video that is going viral.Though mehendi is mostly considered natural and may not really harm the lips but Brianah's beauty experiment has been considered bizarre considering South Asians have never experimented with mehendi as a lip colour. Also, doctors all across will in all probability advise one against applying mehendi on the lips as the oils it contains may leave a burning sensation on your lips.After the video was widely shared on Twitter, Tweeple went on a trolling spree and here are some hilarious tweets about the henna video.Well, no prizes for guessing what happened in the end - The blogger took to social media later to announce that her beauty experiment failed and the lip stain caused her allergies. In the second video, she explained how it took her almost two days for the allergy to completely fade away.We'd advise you to stay away from such beauty blunders! Stay safe ladies."
Try skin icing to achieve smooth and glowing skin,,"Cold therapy has been used by facialists as a part of skincare treatments for quite some time now. Skin icing does seem to have caught on all the more in this lockdown. There are so many celebrities and influencers out there who are making it a part of their skincare rituals and posting all the benefits of the same on their social media. The science behind skin icing is to reduce your skin temperature which in turn keeps many skin concerns away. These include open pores, inflammation, puffiness, etc. Skin icing will help tighten the blood vessels and boost microcirculation as well.If you do it the right way, icing will help in reducing puffiness, water retention and inflammation. It also helps in shrinking enlarged pores as well as help in contouring your face when you make the right strokes. Icing your face can also be done on top of a sheet mask or right before you apply serum to help with better penetration of products. If your skin is dry, too much icing will only worsen the condition. This is because when the ice water evaporates, it takes with skin its natural moisture as well. You need to make sure that you wrap the ice cube in a thin and soft cloth and not use it directly on your skin. Over-icing will also lead to ice burns, hence be mindful. Don't over-do it or keep it on your face for too long.Like more skin products and beauty treatments, icing is not a one-size-fits-all kind of therapy. It depends mainly on your skin type and skin conditions. The safest way to practice skin icing is by using ice-cubes made of plain filtered water infused skin-friendly ingredients or using a cold frozen spoon under your eyes to get rid of puffiness. Using anti-inflammatory and antioxidant-rich green tea or chamomile tea to create ice cubes will help your skin control oil production and inflammation.For sensitive skin, it is recommended to use oats due to it's calming properties. Freeze oat milk and use these cubes on the face for less than once a day for a few minutes only. Be wary of oats or gluten allergies before you try this one out. If you are someone who battles acne, it is suggested to use ice cubes that contain neem, aloe vera and mint leaves with a tad bit of tea tree oil. This reduces oil secretion and it is also antiseptic, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial.For under the eyes, you can use green tea cucumber juice infused ice cubes. Green tea will tighten the blood vessels while the cucumber will act as an astringent and a calming agent. You can make use of this under your eyes every day but you need to make sure that you apply eye cream soon in order to seal in the moisture. This combination works amazingly on tired and screen-sensitive eyes too.If you're someone who wishes to achieve an instant glow, you can freeze a mixture of amla juice and yogurt . This will help in moisturising the skin and also add a lot of proteins and vitamin C to your skin. You can use this a few times a week for great results."
Why Indian women experience the pressure to get married,,"You’ve probably rejected your mother's pleas a million times when it comes to ‘looking for rishtas’ aka marriage. Countless WhatsApp photos of guys, or a sudden, surprised meeting of the guy and his family, coordinated with your parents are not really common. Feeling pressurised to marry is one of the most common feelings that Indian women have to endure.It is believed that it doesn’t matter if you are successful or not, getting married should be one of your main priorities. Countless women in India feel pressurised to marry and relate it to their self-worth. Society has proclaimed that women have to get married and carry on a family’s legacy because it’s all part of the culture. Generations of women have followed this principle of getting married early and have avoided their preferences and likes in many ways possible. However, if any women dared to follow their heart and decided to marry later, the overtowering personality of the society looked down on these women, enough to make their confidence crumble.Society’s deep-rooted issues with women’s superiority have been there for centuries. Even if women were successful, they had to get married before it got difficult to produce babies. “Get married quickly, your biological clock is ticking,” is what all women hear when they reach their late 20s. As a result, after some time, dedicate themselves to finding a suitable groom to escape society’s judgemental clutches. They not only feel pressurised but also unknowingly develop wishes to get married. They feel that their self-worth is not measured by themselves or their success but by their marriage.For Indian women, as per societal judgements and scriptures, the right time to get married is after you turn 25. Even if you fight off saying you have your life to live a little more, your parents are determined to get you married at least by 29. If you reach 30, there are constant worries how others will react!If you chose your career over your marriage, chances are that you’ll be forever labelled as a rebel. To escape from this, women restrain themselves and their wishes.But, no matter what, it’s really important to realise that the only right time to get married is when you want to. No pressure, no judgements, but only your decision. Marriage is a lifetime commitment and you should have a say in when or who you marry. There are countless duties and responsibilities that can seem suffocating and tiresome. Relentless pressure and crying from parents shouldn’t nudge you to get married as soon as you turn 25 or near your 30s. Parents and relatives fear that with time, men wouldn’t want to marry a woman who isn’t young.You family may pursue you with the intention of living a lavish and materialistic life, but if you don’t agree, you’ll be termed as a spoiled brat for not wanting lavishness in a marriage. You want someone with the same taste, comforting, familiar or someone who likes pineapple pizza as much as you like.The goal is to get married when you feel like it. With many social media stories and campaigns promoting women’s choices to be as equal to others, it’s still not too late to defy society and seek your heart out."

She neither had a proper education nor had an idea about how online videos work but still her YouTube channel ‘Aapli Aaji’ (Our grandmother) managed to garner over six lakh subscribers in just six months.It all started in January, when her 17-year-old grandson Yash Pathak asked her to make some Pav Bhaji and was amazed to see how well it was made.In an interview with The Better India Yash said, “Sometime around January, I told my grandma to cook Pav Bhaji for me. After watching a couple of recipe videos, she said she could make a better one. I don’t know what she changed from the recipe videos, but the food was loved in the family. That is when the idea struck me to come up with a channel.”The first video which the grandson-grandma duo uploaded on YouTube was a bitter gourd recipe. “It started getting viewers. Eventually, we uploaded recipes of groundnut chutney, green vegetables, Maharashtrian sweet dishes, eggplant and other traditional food recipes,” he added.Suman Dhamne recalls how she was too nervous to face the camera when her grandson proposed the idea of posting recipe videos. “I was very excited about the idea when Yash proposed the idea to me. But I never faced a video camera in my life and used to get very uncomfortable initially. I used to be very conscious about my looks, the movements and if everything is going as planned,” Suman said.From giving his grandma tech support and editing the videos, to making her learn the pronunciation of ingredients, Yash has been a constant support for Suman Dhamne.A major blow came to the duo when the channel got hacked on October 17. The hackers ran a bitcoin live stream on the link and some videos disappeared from the channel.“I was upset and skipped the meals for the day,” Suman said. “My grandson had done so much of hard work and the videos just disappeared one day,” Suman Dhamne said.The channel eventually got restored in about four days and even the videos came back.Her channel has around 120 videos of different dishes and recipes. With millions of views and subscribers, Suman Dhamne has dedicated herself to bringing new and exciting recipes to her viewers.“The viewers often get tempted by the colour of the food items and spices. They also request to have a call and discuss the recipe. Hundreds of people have asked for the spices.”The duo has also started the commercial sale of their traditional spices after getting several enquiries from the viewers.“I did not know what YouTube was and never thought about putting recipes on social media. But now I feel uneasy if I do not share any recipe on the channel,” said Suman Dhamne."

Home Credit Loan: Home Loan Eligibility: What is the maximum amount of home loan one can borrow?,,"Here are some of the points that will determine the amount of your home loan:

2. Your eligibility

3. Your affordability of paying EMIs

The maximum home loan amount you can get depends on your credit worthiness and borrowing potential determined in terms of the norms and standards of the bank.Usually builders ask buyers to pay 10-20 per cent of the value of the property as downpayment. Rest 80-90 per cent can be financed from the bank. You can choose to pay more from your pocket if you can afford. You must save up for the downpayment before finalaysing a property. In case, there is a deficit, you might have take soft loan from your employer, family and friends. Try to minimise the borrowing amount to reduce the interest outgo.Home loan lenders have a list of eligibility criterion and only if you happen to meet those, you are considered a potential borrower. Banks typically look at your credit history to understand your repayment habits and prefer a credit score of 750 for lending out. Your age, income, occupation, collateral security, margin requirements, etc. are also important factors when it comes to determining the interest on the loan.Many times buyers take up a lot of burden when it comes to paying EMI thinking that it would get easier with time, as their income would increase eventually. Consider the possibilities of not getting a raise soon or other unforeseen circumstances. You should look at a loan to income ratio of 20% to 30%. You can make changes in the tenure to reduce or increase the EMI amount depending on your affordability."

Also, interest paid on housing loans is allowed as a deduction to the extent of Rs. 2 lakh in respect of self-occupied property,"" she added.She also purposed to increase the surcharge on those in the highest income bracket. FM said, ""Those in highest income bracket need to contribute more to national development.

BLOG | SCORECARD

SUNRISERS HYDERABAD THRASH DELHI CAPITALS BY 88 RUNS

Rashid Khan (Sunrisers Hyderabad):

The ball came out nicely, but we won the game more importantly. The wicket was helping a lot. The more you bowl in the right areas. To bowl economically is what I am focusing on, whether I get wickets or not... I focus on bowling dot balls and it helps me get wickets and also helps to take wickets at the other end. I just go with a clear mind. I never think about the scoreboard, what the target is, what;s a good score if we bowl first. I always think I should bowl in the right areas. As long as you bowl there you can trouble anyone. You got to play with the batsman's mind. Keep mixing it up seeing what the batsman is trying to do.

Shreyas Iyer (Delhi Capitals):

Definitely a big loss for us but you can't really bog down from this point of time. We still have two games left but one win is really important, that's what we are waiting for since the last three games. Back-to-back losses is definitely going to put us under the pump. The boys are really strong, really motivated and this loss is definitely going to motivate us. We lost the game in the powerplay itself. Getting 70 runs in the first six overs was really commendable and the way they went after our bowlers was amazing. We need to have that strong and positive mindset. These losses are not going to put us down. As a team, we have been doing amazing throughout so these few matches shouldn't get into our heads. Next match, we'll see to it that we have done our studies right, we'll also see to it that we are putting in our best efforts on the field. It's really difficult to judge what to do on this wicket because it keeps changing any time, so the best thing is to lose the toss. I was contemplating whether to bat or to bowl, unfortunately I won the toss (laughs). We decided that the dew factor will play a massive role, but the ball was stopping a bit. It was really difficult to get off to a great start.

CAPTAINS' TAKE:

David Warner (SRH):

I was actually looking to bat first. (on his birthday celebration) I can't understand this cake-in-the face business (laughs), it's quite messy. It was disappointing to lose that last game with a lot of wickets in hand.

Shreyas Iyer (DC):

We'll bowl first. The wicket looks dry and the dew factor coming in later is a factor. That (the trends) definitely goes into our mind but we were constantly batting first in the early part of the tournament. But the wickets have become drier and that's affected our plans. We want to end up in the top-two, and the boys are really motivated. After some bad performances, we sat together and talked about where we went wrong. Same team.

TOSS: Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer wins toss, opts to field against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

Both the captains - David Warner (SRH) and Shreyas Iyer (DC) - are in the middle for the toss.

"
Bihar election 2020: Campaigning for first phase ends,,"More on

PATNA: In what has ultimately turned out to be a high-decibel campaigning by the leaders of political parties in the Bihar assembly polls, the electioneering for the 71 seats going to polls in the first phase on October 28 ended Monday, belying the early fears that voters were largely disinterested.On Monday, while the state police and central government officials were busy overseeing preparations of stage for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s second-leg address at Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur and Patna on October 28, chief minister Nitish Kumar addressed four rallies, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav from the RJD-led grand alliance 12, and BJP national president J P Nadda delivered address at two places, mainly for the second phase which will go to the polls on November 3.The first phase of polling has already witnessed campaigning by PM Modi at three places and by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at two places on October 23. Their address schedule had even coincided with PM addressing a rally at Bhagalpur and Rahul at Kahalgaon, just 35 km apart.The BJP marshalled resources like 13 helicopters and its 40 star campaigners, including PM Modi, Nadda, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, defence minister Rajnath Singh and UP CM Adityanath Yogi, besides state leaders like deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and health minister Mangal Pandey. On the other hand, the RJD mustered just one helicopter and the Congress two.However, the Covid-19 caused its own share of inflictions, as Fadnavis, Sushil Modi and Pandey went in quarantine, and two ministers, one each from the BJP and JD(U), died due to the lethal attack in the pandemic.In the first phase, there are 1,066 candidates in the fray and over 21.46 lakh people will exercise their franchise. Among its 29 candidates, the BJP has fielded Commonwealth Games gold medalist Shreyasi Singh from the Jamui seat. The RJD’s Divya Prakash (28), contesting the Tarapur seat, is the youngest among all candidates. The JD(U) and RJD are contesting 42 seats each and the Congress is fighting on 20 constituencies.Moreover, the 71 seats are spread over 16 districts, which lie in south Bihar (or south of the river Ganga), including 14 districts which were hit by Maoist activities at one time or the other.Battling the high-incumbency factor, the NDA’s CM face and JD(U) national president Nitish Kumar has addressed meetings in around three dozen constituencies to protect his turf. However, his pitch has been made slippery after Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan decided to fielded his party's candidates against the JD(U) nominees.Nitish has been banking mainly on the preponderant extremely backward caste (EBC), and also women sections on account of the complete prohibition that he imposed in the state in 2016, besides the steps taken for their empowerment - like 50% reservation in the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PTIs) and urban local bodies, as well as 35% job reservation for women in government jobs.However, the CM aspirant from the RJD-led grand alliance, Tejashwi Yadav, continued to build pressure on the NDA and also queer its pitch from Day one, as he promised to give 10 lakh jobs to youths in the state.His physical rallies have attracted more people, including youths, forcing the doubting Thomases to wonder whether the people would also show up at the polling booths to vote for the Grand Alliance.Both PM Modi and Nitish took the fight to the RJD-led grand alliance by reminding people of the 15-year “Lalu Rabri rule”, dubbing it as ‘jungle raj’ and saying that it was bereft of developmental initiatives and activities. In contrast, they said the NDA rule saw all around development activities, including in the road, bridge and power sector, from 2005-2020.The BJP leaders have also raised the issues of Galwan Valley skirmish between India and China, sacrifice by jawans of Bihar Regiment, Pakistan, terror attacks, abrogation of Article 370, declaration of Gupkar Alliance against abrogation of Article 370, and construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya."

Vaccine hopes rise as Oxford jab prompts immune response among old as well as young adults,,"Common cold virus

LONDON: One of the world's leading Covid-19 experimental vaccines produces a immune response in both young and old adults, raising hopes of a path out of the gloom and economic destruction wrought by the novel coronavirus The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc , which is helping manufacture the vaccine, said on Monday.A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.""It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the Covid-19 disease severity is higher,"" an AstraZeneca spokesman said.""The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,"" the spokesman said, referring to the technical name of the vaccine.The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate, as the world tries to plot a path out of the Covid-19 pandemic.The news that older people get an immune response from the vaccine is positive because the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus.If it works, a vaccine would allow the world to return to some measure of normality after the tumult of the pandemic.British health secretary Matt Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready but he was preparing logistics for a possible roll out mostly in the first half of 2021.Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year he told the BBC: ""I don't rule that out but that is not my central expectation.""""The programme is progressing well, (but) we're not there yet,"" Hancock said.Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the Financial Times reported earlier.Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, the FT said. It did not name the publication.People aware of the results from so-called immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants say the findings echo data released in July that showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55.AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial.It resumed the US trial of the experimental vaccine after approval by US regulators, the company said on Friday.Staff at a London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, The Sun newspaper reported on Monday."
"IPL 2020, SRH vs DC: Sunrisers Hyderabad crush Delhi Capitals by 88 runs",,"Delhi skipper, Shreyas Iyer, admits that it is a big loss for them but says that they cannot bog down. Thinks that one win is very important for them and feels that they are motivated after this loss. Thinks they lost the game in the Powerplay with the ball as they gave away 70 runs. Tells that they need to be strong as these losses cannot put them down and further says that they will see to it that they do their studies right and put in better effort. On whether he made the wrong decision at the toss, he says it is tough to choose what to do on this pitch after winning the toss. So, he feels it is better to lose it. Smiles and says he was unfortunate to win it. Tells that they discuss a lot about opposition batsmen and feels that it was unfortunate that they did not do well with the ball and credits Hyderabad for their performance. Shreyas feels any team can surprise anyone and one cannot underestimate anyone. Tells that it will be a good competition in the next two games."

DUBAI: Three-time champions Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) have been knocked out of the race to secure an IPL playoffs ' berth for the first time after Rajasthan Royals (RR) defeated Mumbai Indians (MI) by eight wickets in Abu Dhabi.FIXTURESThe Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side had made it to the playoffs in each of the 10 IPL seasons that it participated since the league started in 2008. However, CSK endured an inconsistent run in this IPL.Dhoni's men notched up an eight-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore on Sunday to keep their slim chances alive for a few hours.But their hopes ended when RR beat MI later in the day.The win over RCB took CSK to eight points from 12 matches but they can only achieve a maximum of 12 points if they win their last two games, which won't be enough to seal a place in the playoffs.In the points table, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and RCB are already on 14 points with Kolkata Knight Riders at 12 with three games to go, followed by Kings XI Punjab and RR -- both on 10 points each with three and two matches left, respectively.""We don't really have a chance to make it to the play-offs, leave the mathematical part of it,"" Dhoni had said after CSK beat RCB on Sunday.""You have to enjoy the game no matter where you are on the table. If you are not enjoying the cricket, it can become cruel and painful. So I am glad with how the youngsters have responded.""CSK had won back-to-back titles in 2010 and 2011, before reclaiming the crown in 2018 following a two year gap. They also ended up runners-up five times.CSK will take on KKR on Thursday in their penultimate game."

"Peshawar Blast today: Bomb at seminary in Pakistan kills 7 children, wounds 70",,"A rescue worker examines the scene of the blast at a religious school in Peshawar. (AFP photo)

PESHAWAR: A powerful bomb blast ripped through an Islamic seminary on the outskirts of the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar on Tuesday morning, killing at least seven children and wounding 70 others, police and a hospital spokesman said.

The bombing happened while a cleric was delivering a lecture about the teachings of Islam at the main hall of the Jamia Zubairia madrassa, said police officer Waqar Azim.

He said initial investigations suggest the bomb went off minutes after someone left a bag at the madrassa.

Several of the wounded were in critical condition, and hospital authorities feared the death toll could climb further.

Peshawar is the provincial capital of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan.

The province has been the scene of such militant attacks in recent years, but sectarian violence has also killed or wounded people at mosques or seminaries across Pakistan.

The latest attack comes two days after a bombing in the southwestern city of Quetta killed three people.

Chakraborty is accused of abetting the suicide of Rajput, who was her boyfriend.The actress, who is the complainant in the case against Rajput's Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, filed an affidavit in the HC on Tuesday opposing their plea and said the allegations against them are serious.Chakraborty also said since the probe in the case against Rajput's sisters is at a nascent stage, time needs to be given to the investigating agency.In the affidavit filed through her advocate Satish Maneshinde, the actress said a forged and fabricated medical prescription was used to help Rajput procure medicines that are banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.""Rajput died merely five days after he obtained the said prescription, wherein he was unlawfully prescribed psychotropic substances at the behest of his sister (Priyanka) and Dr Tarun Kumar,"" Chakraborty said in her affidavit.It needs to be investigated whether Rajput consumed the medicines prescribed, which may have contributed to his death and/or further deteriorated his mental health, the affidavit said.The petition (of Rajput's sisters) should be dismissed, it said.The petition came up before a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik which posted it for further hearing November 4 after both the CBI and the Mumbai Police, which had registered the FIR, sought time to file their affidavits.The Bandra police here on September 7 lodged the FIR against Rajput's sisters and Dr Tarun Kumar of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi, who signed the medical prescription.Rajput's sisters in their petition filed on October 6 sought the case to be quashed and by way of interim relief prayed for a direction to the CBI, to whom the case was handed over by the city police, not to take any coercive steps against them.The CBI is already probing a complaint lodged by Rajput's father K.K. Singh accusing Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting his sons suicide.Chakraborty in her affidavit said Rajput had a ""tumultuous relation"" with his family and was also suffering from mental problems for which he was undergoing medical treatment.In November 2019, Rajput was examined by three psychiatrists who all opined that he was suffering from bipolar disorder and prescribed him medications, the affidavit filed by the actress said, adding that Rajput was fine till he was having his medicines regularly.""In January 2020, Rajput went to Chandigarh to meet his family. After he returned, he said he was discontinuing his medications and treatment,"" the affidavit claimed.""In March 2020, when the country was hit by COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown was announced, Rajput appeared stable initially, but with each passing day his mental health started deteriorating,"" it said.""The death of actors Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan also had a tremendous impact on Sushant Singh Rajput who seemed to have spiraled into depression.

Coronavirus vaccine update: Why Oxford-Astrazeneca's safe immune response for the elderlies is good news for the world,2020-10-27 16:16:42+05:30,"The vaccine, which is undergoing critical phase III testing has been deployed for trials in several countries including India, USA and South Africa. Not only does this give researchers a good pool of volunteers to test the vaccine on, but it also allows them access to geographically diverse populations. Considering how studies have suggested that COVID-19 could affect certain racial groups and ethnic minorities differently, creating a vaccine which works for all is equally important. This is one hiccup which Oxford researchers would have been able to take care of and step ahead in the game in comparison to its competitors.

My COVID story: I had a severe kind of throbbing headache,,"Geetha Sundar had to travel to Chennai from Mumbai for a death in her family. Within 4 days of her return, she experienced dry cough which was followed by running nose, loss of smell and extreme lethargy. When the fever persisted for 4-5 days, the family went for the test and they tested positive. Here’s her COVID journeyCOVID-19 is not a killer infection but only an infection similar to the flu. If one knows about its characteristics, one shall come out of it with flying colours. Here I would like to mention the fear and the trauma which accompanies a COVID-19 positive person and the precautions one should observe post getting out of the infection.I got COVID-19 as we had to travel to Chennai for a death in our family. Maybe proper distancing was not maintained by the anxious passengers while disembarking from the flight on our return which led to this and within 4 days of my return to Mumbai, I started feeling unwell. First the symptom was only dry cough which made me think that it was nothing, only some allergy. The next day I was down with a slight running nose, no sense of smell, along with a feeling of extreme lethargy. Household chores like cooking and cleaning became difficult because of the fatigue and all the while there was fever which was around 100 degree, not very high, but at times intense. All these symptoms were similar to the common cold and the treatment was on those lines. With the fever subsisting for 4/5 days and this coupled with the fact that I had travelled led to the suspicion that it could be the Virus and then we went for the test which turned out to be positive. Immediately, we chose to institutionally quarantine ourselves in a hotel for the continued safety of us and others around us.My life in quarantine was a new life where there was uncertainty as to whether I will sail through this ordeal successfully or not. I had severe headaches as if someone was banging something on my head and this was probably an indication that the virus was at its peak. Accompanied with fever, I was having untold difficulty. I was put on a course of HCQs and Azithromycin and slowly the headache and uneasiness started to subside and I started feeling better. It’s a new life in quarantine where you are confined to a 10 by 10 room with no visitors allowed and you are also not allowed to step out.With loneliness haunting you, you are supposed to be cheerful and be in a positive state of mind. I started doing my daily yoga, pranayama while watching TV, reading books and sketching which gave me great relief and helped me keep my poise and control. I saw the outside world through the only window in the room and I have done sketches of what all I saw. Food was delivered outside the room in a packet - three times a day, but you had no control on the menu. What was on offer had to be consumed. The biggest advantage of being in quarantine is it gives you time to recover by reducing the strain on yourself but it could also lead to boredom and depression if not handled well. On the 14th day, we tested negative then started making plans for our return back home.Yes. Every individual is vulnerable as the virus does not show its true colour outwardly; co morbid and elderly people are more susceptible. It affects all sections of people without differentiation and it is not possible to pinpoint the source of infection. Initial symptoms like dry cough, fatigue, body pain and fever are very similar to common cold and lulls one into a sense of complacency. This needs to be avoided and any uneasiness in the body has to be viewed with suspicion and medical assistance sought as otherwise the condition can deteriorate very rapidly leading to hospitalisation. Diagnostic tools like blood test, X-ray and ECG will be resorted to decide the severity of infection and the course of treatment. It took nearly four weeks to get back to my normal self from the onset of symptoms even though my symptoms were mild.When I was not affected by COVID-19, I did not think about the consequences of contracting it. First and foremost, it is better not to neglect any symptoms. Even if the symptoms are very mild, one should go for testing because the doctor said that “the virus stays in our body for only 8 to 10 days but the level of CRP[c- reactive protein] and also the virus load in a person makes the difference when it comes to the fatality of the patients.” When the level of CRP is high, it affects the lung, heart and other body parts severely. So, it’s better to go for the test [RC-PCR] because from outside one will not be able to judge the intensity of the virus.I had undergone a CRP as well as D-Dimer test. In my case the CRP level was higher than my husband so I was given Azithromycin apart from HCQs. Apart from washing hands, wearing masks and maintaining distance, try to eat more fresh fruits, vegetables and protein-based foods. Doing exercise, having sound sleep, yoga and pursuing one’s hobbies are important. Those who are co morbid [Heart patient, Diabetes etc] have to take their other medicines regularly and should avoid stress anxiety regarding Covid19.When we got Covid, we really did not know how to react to the people around us. We felt insecure and lost. We could not get immediate transportation to reach the quarantine facility. Most of the time the fear that we should not be causing inconvenience to others preoccupied our minds. The fear of “What Next” was intriguing to us no end.Once it affects a person, it takes nearly four weeks to come back to normal life. It’s better to have a thermometer, as well as Pulse Oximeter [to find out the level of fever, Oxygen level in the blood and the pulse rate] at home and this comes in handy. The pulse oximeter which measures the level of oxygen saturation is especially important as any sudden dip in the levels to below 90 is an indication of breathlessness and may require ventilation and immediate medical attention. My sincere request is that please maintain social distance and try to avoid going out as much as possible. Having a contented life is a great virtue at this point of time till a proper medicine or vaccine is in place in front of us for prompt treatment."

Coronavirus: Subtle signs that can tell you have already had COVID-19 before,2020-10-20 14:09:49+05:30,"The only way your body ""protects"" you from COVID is by building up antibodies. Antibodies develop when a body battles the virus, recognizes its proteins and creates infection-fighting antibodies that give you immunity against the illness. The only way, right now, to confirm this would be to get an antibody test, which can detect the level of COVID fighting antibodies in the system.

However, since studies have emerged that antibodies start to wane in patients 2-3 months after illness, it might not give the most accurate results.

My COVID story: I had taken COVID test only as a precautionary measure,,"Having arrived in India to be with her ailing mother, Shruti A did not know she would go through such difficult times. She lost her mother, and also found herself to be COVID positive. Here she shares her battle with COVID-19 and how she managed to keep her spirits high during the tough time. Read onI never thought I would sit down to write this, given the private person that I am. But I will remember 2020, the year of the pandemic and I was one of the 27.9 million cases. I was visiting India due to my mother’s emergency condition and it was also during this time that my mother breathed her last. After my mandatory quarantine (post international travel), I and my family were fortunate to perform her last rites and after a week or two, I started helping my father and brother with regaining momentum with their routine.It was also during this time, the paranoia bit me and although we three were maintaining healthy habits like regularly drinking herbal tea, taking supplements and had no suspicious symptoms, I insisted on scheduling a covid test (rtPCR) as a precautionary measure. It was the morning of September 8, when my morning customary coffee was interrupted by a phone call. The voice on the other side said, ‘You’ve been tested covid positive’… That very news shook me to the core, and I exclaimed, “I am Covid positive???”I remember crying to my partner, brooding over why and how I contracted this despite following all safety measures. As unbelievable and dreadful as it was, it was the truth. I had to only find peace in the fact that my father (65) and brother (24), were negative.I had to immediately isolate myself from my family and since I was asymptomatic, I could choose a private hotel. Cut to 12 pm, I am in my hotel room, anxious as to how my next 10 days would look. In the meantime, I also reached out to my relatives and close friends informing them of the same. I tried to keep my morale high and told myself ‘You’re covid positive, but congratulations, you’re asymptomatic, and there’s only one way out, just get OUT OF IT!!’The same time, some of my family friends recommended being in touch with a doctor to monitor my health remotely, who advised me to maintain a healthy diet, exercise, positive attitude and record my vitals (temperature and oxygen levels) twice a day. From my experience in these 14 days, I can definitely vouch for the following if you find yourself in my shoes.Do not, I repeat, DO NOT PANIC; stay calm and isolate yourselfWash your hands oftenGet in touch with your doctorMonitor your health, take vitals (if you can procure the medical devices), be vigilant and be comfortable with your doctor to inform him/ her of any unusual symptomsMaintain a healthy diet, avoid junk and oily foodMake sure to stay hydrated, drink at least 7-8 glasses of water everydayGargle and inhale steam if you can, while quarantinedIndulge in yoga/ physical activity while in isolationlisten to music, soothe your mind and talk to your family membersLimit screen timeIt can be really tough within the four walls, given that there is always a possibility of developing symptoms. However, yoga and reading helped me achieve a positive frame of mind. This experience has also changed the way I looked at life – I am fortunate enough to be asymptomatic and suffering less than the population with severe symptoms.When you know your body is combatting a deadly virus, you know it is not the easiest fact to live with, however I have come out stronger and learnt the importance of self-care. I have made it my new normal to incorporate yoga in my routine and eating and drinking healthy. Mental strength & positive attitude is all you need. I kept reminding myself that “Every experience in life serves as a challenge, so be thankful it happened, live it and grow through it”.How did I keep my spirits high? Whenever I found myself dreading “Why me?” I’d just smile and tell myself “yeah, I have a story to tell my grandkids that their grandma survived the covid pandemic”."

Navratri is one of the most famous Hindu festivals which is celebrated not only in India but all across the globe. The word Navratri is derived from two Sanskrit words—'nava' meaning nine and 'ratri' meaning night. This festival celebrates the defeat of Mahishasura by Goddess Durga and signifies the victory of good over evil. In many parts of India people fast for seven days and break it on the last day of Navratri, only after performing puja. Garba is performed in large groups, while people rejoice this fun-filled festival with their friends and family.This year the nine-day festival would be observed from Oct 17 to October 25. According to the Hindu Panchang, this year Navratri will begin on the Pratipada date of the Shukla Paksha of Ashwin month, which falls on October 17. The auspicious puja time of the first day of Navratri is from 6:23 am to 10:30 pm. Here is the day wise puja schedule for Navratri 2020-On 17th October 2020- Pratipada GhatasthapanaOn 18th October 2020- Dwitiya Maa Brahmacharini PujaOn 19th October 2020- Maa Chandraghanta PujaOn 20th October 2020- Chaturthi Maa Kushmanda PujaOn the 21st October 2020- Panchami Maa Skandamata PujaOn the 22nd October 2020- Shashthi Maa Katyayani PujaOn the 23rd October 2020- Saptami Maa Kalratri PujaOn the 24th October 2020- Ashtami Maa Mahagauri Durga Maha Navami PujaOn the 25th October 2020- Navami Maa Siddhidatri Navratri Paran Vijay DashamThe legend associated with Navratri is associated with the great battle that took place between the demon named Mahishasura and Goddess Durga. Mahishasura was said to be blessed with immortality by Lord Brahma under one condition that he could be defeated only by a woman.The blessing of immortality got to his head and filled him with evil intentions. Mahishasura then went on to attack Trilok--earth, heaven and hell. Since only a woman could defeat him, even the Gods didn't stand a chance against him. The worried Gods prayed to Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva and sought their help to defeat Mahishasura.Lord Vishu took the decision to create a woman to defeat Mahishasura. He created the powerful Goddess Durga. Then Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma also put together all their powers in the Goddess.Durga fought with Mahishasura relentlessly and the battle went on for 15 long dasys. It was a fight that shook the entire Trilok. During the fight, the clever Mahishasura kept changing his forms to confuse his opponent Goddess Durga. Ultimately, when the demon took the form of a buffalo, Goddess Durga pierced his chest with her 'trishul', which finally killed him.This marked the end of the demon and marked the victory of the good over the evil.On each day of Navaratri different avatars of Goddess Durga are worshipped. On the first day, people worship Goddess Shailputri while Goddess Brahmacharini is worshipped on the second day. On the third day, people pay homage to Goddess Chandraghanta and on the fourth day Goddess Kushmanda is worshipped.

The combined terror of pollution and COVID,,"Amid fear and uncertainties, what the pandemic also brought along was clean blue sky and breathable air. However, with ease in lockdown rules, the air quality is back to being poor again.Air pollution is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, resulting in approximately 5 million deaths every year. Currently in Delhi, people are reporting breathing issues and children are facing throat problems due to contaminated air.Experts now warn that if necessary steps are not taken, poor air quality could make the spread and severity of COVID-19 far worse this winter. Pune-based Dr. Sushrut Ganpule, Consultant- Chest Physician, Jupiter Hospital explains, “It is highly likely that increased suspended particulate matters and rising wind speed could transport the virus faster and wider. Therefore, it is important to take these warnings seriously for states with huge concentrations of the virus and implement strict anti-pollution protocols, increase testing and overall strengthen the health care system for a potential surge in the number of cases during the winter months, especially in the northern plains.”It is known that tiny pollutants can lead to big heart health issues. In fact, almost 20% of deaths due to cardiovascular causes are attributed to air pollution. Dr Santosh Kumar Dora, Senior Cardiologist, Asian Heart Institute, Mumbai explains, “For existing heart patients, air pollution can cause significant harm as their heart function is already compromised. In some heart patients, where the lungs are also congested, exposure to air pollution can rapidly deteriorate their health.”He advises people to take various measures to combat air pollution. They can ensure they do not live near factories or major roadways. They should be wearing face masks and installing air purifiers in homes.People with respiratory problems need to be extra careful amid COVID-19. Dr Davinder Kundra, consultant- Pulmonology, HCMCT Manipal Hospitals warns, “Air pollution triggers respiratory problems and people suffering from such diseases have been put on a very high risk for COVID-19. Currently, the National Capital Region is witnessing bad quality of air due to various reasons including agricultural residue burning. If precautions are not taken well in advance for winters, when air pollution would be on its peak, population health management would face a very tough task to cope up with pollution-triggered diseases and COVID-19. It would be a double whammy for the residents of Delhi.”The combined effects of air pollution cause a very large number of premature deaths every year due to weakened immune systems, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections. Exposure to ambient air pollution can lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma symptoms.Among respiratory diseases, asthma and COPD are the major concerns and that needs special attention. If infected by the virus, a patient’s condition may deteriorate rapidly.To safeguard ourselves from pollution and COVID-19, use of face masks is a must. Mask prevents the transmission of infection but also protects people from inhaling air pollutants to a larger extent. Older people need to stay inside during day time to protect themselves from air pollution.Presently due to COVID , the government has made it mandatory for everyone to wear a mask while stepping out of their homes. The safest mask to filter out coronavirus is the N-95 mask. Coronavirus measure approximately 0.125 micron. So N-95 masks will be very useful to filter out the PM2.5 and PM 10 particles very effectively. Studies have shown triple layered surgical masks and multilayered cotton masks are also effective to prevent coronavirus spread. As the N-95 mask is costly, these masks are cheaper options. All these masks which protect us from COVID, also will be useful to protect us from PM 2.5 and PM 10 air pollutant particles."

#20YearsOfThenali: Five facts about the Kamal Haasan-starrer that will interest you,2020-10-26 22:24:35+05:30,"Kamal Haasan is known as Ulaganayagan, and the first time the title was used was in this film. The director says, “Kamal sir helped me a lot while making the film. So, I wanted to do something special for him and decided to give him the title Ulaga Nayagan. When I told him of my plan, he was not too keen, but I landed at his home with a camera. He had changed his get-up as he was preparing to shoot Aalavandhan. But I told him I only wanted to shoot his eyes. We shot in high speed, and at the count of five, asked him to wink and smile. I took that footage to the CG department and came up with the visuals – we show his Alwarpet office, pull back to show Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India and then the world, which becomes a small, black circle, which is his eyeballs, and he winks.

"Comedy Couple Review: Saqib, Shweta shine bright in this fresh yet predictable rom-com",,"STORY: Deep Sharma (Saqib Saleem) and Zoya Batra (Shweta Basu Prasad) are a hit pair in the stand-up space. Slowly but surely, the duo is making its presence felt in the digital world, too. But all’s not well in their la la land and the couple finds itself stuck in the middle of many a storm — in their professional as well as personal lives. How do they sail through these difficult times?



REVIEW: Touted to be India’s first and only comedy couple, techie-turned-comic Deep Sharma and his romantic partner Zoya Batra always have their audience rolling with laughter, thanks to the silly yet relatable jokes they crack on stage. But, other than recently attaining the title of being a ‘viral act’ on the internet, the duo has also attracted some unwanted hurdles in their seemingly perfect life. Deep and Zoya, both as different as chalk and cheese, are headed towards troubled waters and they know it all too well. One event leads to another and now they have a conundrum to resolve: whether to keep their differences aside and ride on the wave of their joint success or to shun their collaboration and bow down to what life has in store for them.



Director Nachiket Samant’s ‘Comedy Couple’ is a sweet, endearing love story between an ‘eight/nine on 10’ high-society girl and a self-admittedly average former IT professional from a hamlet in Uttar Pradesh. The narrative is nothing unique but the stand-up angle renders freshness to this otherwise common trope and we dig the chemistry the lead pair shares.



In one of the intimate scenes, Zoya breaks it to Deep that he is a five or six at best on his good days, a compulsive liar and that he isn’t innately funny. Deep agrees without putting up a fight and admits to be an acquired taste as a comedian. The tone and overall vibe of ‘Comedy Couple’ is pretty clear from the start — a desi lad scores an urban belle, finds his lane with her and boom… he is happily dancing to her tunes: both on stage and otherwise. This underlying theme has been a recurring subtext in rom-coms for years now but despite the somewhat predictable diegesis, the flick draws you in with those hilarious one-liners and the stand-up mood and setup in general. Also, Shweta Basu Prasad is a natural as the independent, dominating girlfriend with a knack for sexually charged and socially awkward jokes. Keeping up with Deep’s persona, Saqib downplays his performance in the first half but his character undergoes an ocean of change after the interval. And brownie points to him for acing the colloquial Haryanvi accent!



A surprise package in the film was real-life comedian Aadar Malik’s nutcase, stoned-out-of-mind Rohan. As a filthy man and proud jugadoo (please listen to his seven-staircase story intently), Malik is riotous to a T. Other parallel characters add the right amount of humour to the plotline, but it is Aadar who stands out for his zoned-out act. Another actor who makes an impact with her brief performance is Pooja Bedi as the male-bashing artiste and Zoya’s single parent, Zohra Batra. Bedi channels the spirit of a paradoxical person — claims all men are as*holes and then gets bored of her own boyfriend.



As far as the pace and plot progression go, ‘Comedy Couple’ is off to a rocking start but bumps off to rocky roads soon after. The middle is a bit derailed and draggy, often compromising on its strongest suit: humour. Samant and his army of writers — Raghav Raj Kakker, Kashyap Kapoor, Bikas Ranjan Mishra and Gaurav Sharma — inculcate the hit formulae of comedy, i.e; ‘gaalis’ and ‘sax’ and even bring to light the constant conflict between comedians and pressure groups, but fail to up the ante, especially with that foreseeable climax.



In a nutshell, ‘Comedy Couple’ is your typical Bollywood rom-com with a fresh pair and even fresher central theme. Look the other way if you are pining to witness innovation in this genre, stay if you are in it only for the laughs!

Laghushanka Review: An over-simplistic approach towards a complex problem,,"STORY: A young girl, Shruti — who is about to get married — is suffering from an embarrassing disorder, bed-wetting. Given the fact that she is tying the knot in exactly two days, will Shruti come out clean to her future in-laws before marriage?



REVIEW: Since this social drama is only 15 minutes long, director Nikhil Mehrotra jumps right into the issue at hand — the taboo around discussion pertaining to one’s bed-wetting problem in the sleep. In an emotional scene, Shruti is seen confiding in her supportive yet submissive mother (Kanupriya Pandit) and the limbo that the two of them are in pretty much forms the crux of ‘Laghushanka’. The biggest dilemma that this bride-to-be and her family is facing at the moment is whether to reveal this rather embarrassing secret to her future in-laws or hide it till the wedding nuptials are done with. Is the foundation of Shruti’s married life going to be based on a lie that her clan wants her to tell or is she going to rebel and let the cat out of her bag?



After writing multiple critically-acclaimed Bollywood movies script (co-written ‘Panga’, ‘Dangal’ and ‘Çhhichhore’ to be precise), the short film ‘Laghushanka’ marks the directorial debut of Nikhil Mehrotra. Although the theme is sensitive and there is hardly any content around it, Mehrotra manages to keep it simple and engaging at the same time. Like the discussion within the family where people are more concerned about their wedding outfits than the big revelation itself is wacky and an attention-grabbing technique successfully used by the writer-director. In addition to that, the chaos and commotion surrounding the ongoing marriage preparation adds the right amount of humour to this otherwise serious social commentary. To sum it up, Mehrotra’s writing is taut and goes with the flow but its climax turns out to be predictable. The background music by Mannan Shaah merges well both with the dramatic aspect as well as its funny bits. Some stories make for great short films, but, unfortunately, this one needed a longer run-time.



Shweta Tripathi is convincing in her role as Shruti — her facial expressions and body language have a greater impact than the dialogues she mouths. Kanupriya Pandit and Narottam Baid as worried parents are up to the mark. Other family members have their own ways of pushing the plotline forward with Yogendra Vikram Singh leading the pack as the groom-to-be.



All said, ‘Laghushanka’ is one of those tales that are hard-hitting, intriguing but lack the depth they needed and deserve. This satire could have started a serious discussion on a subject that is barely talked about but ends up being a half-baked attempt at handling something this delicate instead.

Bahut Hua Sammaan Review: An interesting cocktail of comedy and reality,,"STORY: Two struggling engineering students, Bony (Raghav Juyal) and Fundoo (Abhishek Chauhan), are tired of being called failures and want to do something big with their lives. Do they have a plan to become success stories or does life have something else in store for them?



REVIEW: ‘Bahut Hua Sammaan’ revolves around the students of Uttar Bharat University of Varanasi, Bony and Fundoo in particular, who have flunked in their final year. They get frustrated with the fact that their juniors are getting jobs through campus placement while they struggle to even graduate. Pretty soon their lives take a drastic turn when they meet maverick Baba Bakchod (Sanjay Mishra), who sets a plan in motion to earn some quick bucks by robbing the university’s bank lockers. Will this robbery helped them redeem themselves and lead successful lives?



In no time, it becomes evident that Baba Bakchod planned this heist to pocket a very precious possession—the Kohinoor. However, it’s not just him who has his eyes set on the Kohinoor but there are other dangerous people involved as well—notorious Guruji aka Anand Bairagi Maharaj (Dibyendu Bhattacharya), corrupt Union Minister Ajay Singh Parmar (Punkaj Kalraa) and his ruthless assassin, who is also an ex-commando, Lovely Singh (Ram Kapoor). That’s not all, small-time thugs Raju (Bhoopesh Kumar Singh) and Bhola (Sharat Sonu) also try to get their hands on the loot. All in all, things get messier when police inspector, Bobby Tiwari (Nidhi Singh), is roped in to solve the impending case and all the commotion surrounding the heist.



Through ‘Bahut Hua Sammaan’, director Ashish R. Shukla sends out a strong message—loud and clear—we should always be inquisitive and keep questioning the functioning of the government and not just be blind follower of anyone in power. Emphasising on the saying, “Revolution is not a two hours film, it’s a constant force necessary for democracy,” this political satire is off to a rocky start but manages to lure us in with the unfolding of an interesting chain of events. But all that changes when too many sub plots are planted at regular intervals, making the screenplay go haphazard beyond a point of return. Overall, it has all the ingredients needed to cook up a funny, socially-relevant entertainer stance a consistently gripping story.



The writers, Avinash Singh and Vijay Narayan Verma, have penned down a story that is relatable, especially given the current political scenario of the country. And special mention goes to the witty dialogues in local UP dialect that enhances the humour factor in the film. The use of 80’s Hindi numbers like ‘Dhanno Ki Aankhon Mein’ adds a sense of nostalgia to the film. Watch out for the climax, which is, surprisingly, the highlight of the movie.



Coming to the performances, Sanjay Mishra is the star of ‘Bahut Hua Sammaan’ as Baba Bakchod: he is funny and entertaining at the same time. Mishra single-handedly shoulders the burden of taking a narrative forward. Raghav Juyal and Abhishek Chauhan have done a commendable job playing two lost young boys from Varanasi. Both the actors pull off convincing performances as Bony and Fundoo respectively. Ram Kapoor looks deadly as the cold-blooded assassin Lovely. As the hard-nosed police officer Bobby Tiwari, Nidhi Singh renders an outstanding performance that proves to be one of the plus points of this social commentary. Her rapport with her over-enthusiastic on-screen husband Namit Das, who wants to start a family, ups the hilarious quotient of the story.



In a nutshell, ‘Bahut Hua Sammaan’ starts off as a goofy comedy but later turns into a conversation about the ongoing socio-economic and political situation of the country that is laced with humour. The film has its heart in the right place, but, sadly execution falters after a point.

Serious Men Review: An interesting observation on the distinction between haves and have-nots,,"STORY: Hailing from a Dalit family, Ayyan Mani (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) wants his only son Adi (Aakshath Das) to have what he didn’t – a life of privilege, opportunities and respect from all strata of society. Upon realising Adi is a child prodigy, Mani starts cashing in on his newfound fame. But is a child this young ready for all that mic-thrusting, caste-based speeches and a scam that his father’s been running? Through this adaptation, director Sudhir Mishra delves into the age-old class distinction prevalent within Indian society. And the themes of haves and have-nots add the quintessential human drama to this relevant piece of cinema.



REVIEW: For as long as he can remember, Korathi-born and Mumbai-bred Ayyan Mani has always been haunted by the story of how his grandfather died in a running train – someone whispered in his ears that he had accidentally boarded the first-class compartment meant only for Brahmins. Sure, Mani is street smart and it is his strong survival instincts that help him climb up the professional ladder: he is the personal assistant to man-of-science Dr. Acharya (Nassar) at the National Institute of Fundamental Research. But being born into a poor farming family in a remote hamlet in Tamil Nadu has its own ramifications – Mani likes his beer ‘not extremely chilled, not warm’ and is obsessed with a life of dough and dignity for his aankhon-ka-tara Adi. Call it sheer luck or a classic case of rags-to-riches at play, Adi turns out to be a genius who has complex chemical formulae at the tip of his tongue. Also, Mani is running a scam on the side while the nation is revelling in the birth of a genius (they call him chota Einstein at one point). If political leaders are willing to pull the family out of its two-by-two kholi among other generosities, then why the con? Based on Manu Joseph’s book by the same name, director Sudhir Mishra’s ‘Serious Men’ is a satire on the stark contrast (or the lack of it) between the rich and educated and the poor and naïve with slight deviation from its original story.



The opening sequence leads us to an unnamed, dingy and poorly-lit chawl in Mumbai with Mani Senior deciphering life with this uninhibited line – “…zindagi bhi aisi hai, complex! Aadmi bematlab hi paida hota hain, marta bhi bematlab hi hai” – and what ensues thereon is absolute madness, coupled with unabashed greed and, of course, nonchalant scheming and scamming. The trope is all too familiar: a man from a marginalised household is hardened by life and all the curveballs he has dodged so far and wants his son to have a better shot at it; we get that. But what sets Sudhir Mishra’s ‘Serious Men’ apart is the way the story is laid out – so out-there and yet so subtle. Other than the atrocities faced by the Dalit community in India, the narrative also brushes its shoulders with the prevalence of ‘pleas’ to embrace Christianity for a better life and the caste card that’s often played within the subjugated communities. It is bold and ironic but no one’s taking any offence because Mishra has inculcated this subtext with the foil of sarcasm wrapped around it. Besides, Nawazuddin Siddiqui has sprinkled Nawazuddin Siddiqui-ness all over the script and the actor sure knows just how to navigate the tricky lanes without rubbing anyone the wrong way. Speaking of which, the lungi-donning actor in this social commentary gets into the skin of Mani as if they are long-lost brothers. While the dialogues maybe easily forgotten, his expressions in the meltdown scenes are a testament to his acting prowess. The child genius Adi aka Aakshath Das is a cocky young man sharing the ultimate secret with his father and, even at such a tender age, he walks shoulder to shoulder with Siddiqui and their twisted accord is palpable. The duo may have lowered the scale of their moral compass but not the God-fearing Indira Tiwari’s Oja; she sort of balances the borderline megalomania out that the other two latch on to. Shweta Basu Prasad’s Anuja is the poster child of oppression (with a crippled leg, burnt marks and a Carnegie Mellon degree) in this dramedy but her role remains under defined and it is criminal not to use a fine actor to her complete potential. The characters essayed by veteran actors Nassar and Sanjay Narvekar (as the local politician and Anuja’s father) do not have much to do in the film other than safeguard their own selfish interests, which they do with aplomb.



Without revealing the twists and turns – all of which are somewhat predictable yet engaging – this movie is packed with surprises and more often than not leaves one scratching their heads (you will know why). Cinematographer Alexander Surkala captures the essence of Mumbai and its dark alleys and juxtaposes the high-rises against the slums at periodic intervals; thank goodness for that! Karel Antonín’s music has this typical deep, artsy ring to it that could never go wrong with a film trying to highlight the biggest ironies of life but towards the end, both the script and its background score tend to derail: dramatic and distracting.



The serious men of our society are the laughing stock in ‘Serious Men’ and though the film reasonably manages to bring to light the conflict between the elite and the easily disposable, it fails to conclude what could have been an excellent social dialogue on a high note. Guess Mishra took too much credence of Siddiqui’s rant on respect, “Public jisko samajhti nahin hain, usko salaam thokti hain; respect karti hain.”

"Over The Moon Review: Tonally unbalanced, but visually stunning",,"Story: A young girl flies to the moon to prove the existence of a goddess.

Review: Fei Fei (Cathy Ang) grows up believing the legendary myth of Chang’e (Phillipa Soo), a goddess who lives on the moon after losing her beloved. Fei Fei is trying to cope with her own loss, following the death of her mother. Years after the heartbreak, her father (John Cho) begins to date Mrs Zhong (Sandra Oh), which does not go down well with the young girl. Additionally, Mrs Zhong’s little boy Chin (Robert G. Chiu) gets on Fei Fei’s nerves. Agitated by the entire situation, she builds a rocket to fly to the moon, where she can meet Chang’e to show everyone back home that she is real. But more importantly, Fei Fei seeks to prove to her father that true love is meant to last forever.

‘Over the Moon’ is directed by Glen Keane, a veteran of animation for four decades. So, it is no surprise the film excels in that department. Combining the latest styles as well as a traditional design approach, the film is visually enchanting with a burst of colours and vivid imagery. Written by the late Audrey Wells, this story on loss and grief is constructed to ensure the heavy themes are still children-friendly. Characters like Fei Fei’s bunny Bungee and the Gobi the lunar pup, endearingly voiced by Ken Jeong, are introduced explicitly for that purpose – to be the cutesy and lovable, if derivative, comic relief. But while there’s no shortage of light-hearted and emotional moments, the plot is admittedly familiar. It’s padded with subplots, and while there are a couple of standout musical tracks, there is at least an equal number that serves little purpose other than exposition.

The animation and songs also work as ample distraction from the systematic workings of the plot, which, unfortunately, drags at various points. Interspersed between a chaotic set of world rules that aren't clearly defined for audiences unaware of Chinese culture and mythology, the life lessons in ‘Over the Moon’ are certainly well-intended. That, along with dazzling visuals and endearing characters, will make it a captivating watch for younger audiences."
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm Review: A scathing satire that gives the middle finger to political correctness,,"STORY: An unusual feminist sequel to 2006 comedy ‘Borat’, this is a scathing satire and brutal social commentary, that gives the middle finger to political correctness, while making a strong case against misogyny and patriarchy.



REVIEW: The story follows Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) a Kazakhstani TV reporter who is sent to America to bribe the powerful men in order to win favours in return. Trouble ensues when his teen daughter (terrific Maria Bakalova) smuggles herself into the United States to be with her father. The film essentially tells a dad daughter story while highlighting the metaphorical cage that women find themselves trapped in even today.



There’s a reason why this film is so important in 2020. We all want to sound woke on Twitter. Outraging and taking offence to insignificant things is now a popular pastime. Our drive to feel superior to others has given birth to an online pandemic called cancelling culture. It has stripped us off our honesty, as we constantly fear being ostracised for speaking our mind. While it’s fashionable to preach courage, deep down we are a bunch of fearful creatures, who seek validation from random people. Enters the audacious maskini clad Sacha Baron Cohen who questions the status quo in his own shocking ways. His explicit ways to get a point across can be cringe inducing and thus not for everyone. However, if you can overlook the pubes, underarm hair, penis jokes, you are guaranteed to have a good laugh.



Unapologetically feisty, the man has a funny bone but most importantly, a spine. His mockumentaries speak truth to power and make you wonder how we as society are yet to change our mindset. We’ve normalised sexual harassment, hatred against Jews, racism, taboos around menstrual blood, unrealistic standards of female beauty and the denial of female masturbation. The film holds a mirror to not only America but the world in general. We aren’t rattled by human rights abusers.



Ahead of the US elections, the comedian wants Americans to be offended for not thinking straight. The jabs on the right wing supporters and Republicans, especially President Trump, VP Mike ‘fly’ Pence and an expose of sorts on Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani are the film’s jaw dropping moments. The Giuliani scene is a shocking real footage that’s used in the film. It shows the senior attorney reaching into his trousers while reclining on a bed in the presence of the actor playing Borat’s daughter, who is posing as a TV journalist for a fake interview. They are then interrupted by Borat who runs in and says: “She’s 15. She’s too old for you.”



Maria Bakalova is as uninhibited and terrific as Sacha. As the dad-daughter emotional angle takes centre stage, the film loses steam and gets generic. However, it provides you with enough and more awkward laughs that also make you introspect. Ridiculous and harebrained yet insightful and hilarious... this isn’t a perfect film that makes for a pleasant watch but it’s audaciously different and daring.

Nocturne Review: It’s sibling rivalry gone so awry that there’s no coming back from it,,"Teenagers Juliet and Vivian are both enrolled in an elite boarding arts academy, are gifted pianists, but somehow Juliet is always seen as playing the second fiddle to her charismatic, vivacious, outgoing and sexuality-oozing twin sister Vivian, who is older than Juliet by just a few seconds. Vivian is the prodigy, whereas Juliet is the underachiever who is never taken seriously by her peers or teachers. Even before her graduation, Vivian has already been accepted into Juilliard, while Juliet has opted to take a gap year, though not exactly by choice. A determined Juliet is ready to go to any extent to fulfill her musical and other desires. Her need to do so gets stronger every day after she accidentally gets hold of Moira’s mysterious theory book that is scribbled with satanic figures and hidden messages, which help her to foresee her future. From getting her own music teacher suspended to seducing Max (Vivian’s steady boyfriend) and even taking her sister’s place at the school’s annual music function, Juliet’s greed, desire and needs seem limitless. The music used in the movie is one of the best features of the movie. Being a musical, classical and various genres of music have been blended here to prepare you for the next twist.



Moving to the good and not so good parts, the movie gives you a feel of ‘Black Swan,’ ‘Inception,’ ‘The Perfection,’ ‘Whiplash,’ but somehow it gets predictable. The horror, jump scare or surprise elements are very limited. The writers could have delved more into the sibling rivalry angle, the mysterious death of Moira and her family, the drawings on the wall which she drew before jumping off the building and the satanic cult, if any, to keep the viewers hooked. The ending leaves you with many unanswered questions, and even a bit deranged. However, the scenes between Juliet and her music teachers-the gentle and milquetoast Roger (John Rothman), whose career she tries to ruin, or the slick and demanding Henry (Ivan Shaw), who explains to Juliet that “music is a bloodsport” so as to inspire her, or Juliet walking towards her sister with bloody tampons, were some of the most amazing moments. The uneasiness between Iseman and Sweeney’s characters makes us curious to know more about the rivalry and jealousy aspects.



Like most Blumhouse productions, this one limits itself to a handful of décors and characters. ‘Nocturne’ is one of the eight horror movies – a joint venture of Blumhouse Television and Amazon Studios, all slated to release on Amazon Prime. Written and directed by Zu Quirke, this film marks her debut. Well, if you like movies which leave you with many unanswered questions, then this one is for you.



"
Evil Eye Review: A romantic horror with a desi twist,,"From executive producers Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Jason Blum, Evil Eye is part of Welcome to the Blumhouse series, a line-up of eight original films from the Amazon Studios that will premiere directly on its streaming service in October.



Based on an audio play by Madhuri Shekar, who adapted it for film and directed by Indian-American twin brothers Elan and Rajeev Dassani, Evil Eye is a suspense thriller that has veteran Sarita Choudhury playing Usha, a superstitious mother whose concern for her daughter spirals into a fierce nightmare as past penetrates the present.



Usha, like a typical Indian mother, is obsessed with getting her daughter Pallavi (Sunita Mani) married. Trying to succeed at matchmaking from miles away, Usha keeps setting up dates for her 29- year-old-daughter who is born and raised in the US. While waiting at a coffee shop for one of these potential husbands to turn up, Pallavi meets Sandeep (Omar Maskati) who is rich, handsome and also Indian. Pallavi and Sandeep hit it off instantly. Pallavi excitedly tells her mom about her new-found love and how she connected with him immediately. But instead of being happy for her daughter, Usha starts to behave in a very strange manner and is convinced that Sandeep isn’t really who he seems to be. Usha strongly feels that Sandeep is the reincarnation of her own abusive and dangerous boyfriend who tried to kill her many years ago, before she escaped and flew to the United States. The screenplay alternates between New Delhi where Usha and her husband have settled after many years in the US, and New Orleans, where Pallavi lives.



The story of the film mainly revolves around the concepts of reincarnation and karma. In the past, we have seen several Hindi films based on similar themes. Some of the striking examples are Subhash Ghai's Karz, Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om. Choudhury is wonderful in her role as a creepy yet caring and oddly comforting mother. The little nuances of the mother-daughter relationship are the highlight of the film. Bernard White, who plays Krishnan, Usha’s supportive husband is also pretty convincing and real. In fact, Usha and Krishnan's relationship have a healthy dose of both humour and stress as he initially dismisses her doubtful behaviour as paranoia but later starts to feel that she's losing her mental stability and needs a medical expert. Editor Kristina Hamilton-Grobler has done a decent job with the constant back and forth between two continents and from present to past, while bringing to attention disturbing incidences of Usha's younger years.



While the thriller, with its good mix of romance, cultural portrayal and supernatural elements, remains engrossing, it fails to be scary along the way. The flashback scenes aren't always effective, making it hard for the viewer to take the scenes very seriously. Also, the plot makes one expect a lot from Maskati whose performance is largely bland. Moreover, the characters Pallavi and Sandeep lack layers and seem very generic.



To sum it up, Evil Eye is a little dose of supernatural with a dash of desi twist. Watch it if you have an inclination for romantic thrillers."

A Babysitter's Guide To Monster Hunting Review: A mildly entertaining monster saga,,"STORY: A young babysitter on a mission to rescue a child abducted by a Boogeyman, discovers a world full of secret monsters and babysitters.



REVIEW: Kelly Ferguson (Tamara Smart) had her first brush with the Boogeyman Grand Guignol (Tom Felton) when she was five. Now in her freshman year, Kelly’s early experience has led to school bullies calling her ‘Monster Girl’. But a spirited Kelly, who is quite the math whiz-kid, doesn’t get bogged down by the bullying. It’s Halloween and she’s excited to go to the party, so she could have a chance with the one guy she’s crushing on. However, her mother Alexa (Crystal Balint) forces Kelly to babysit her boss Ms Zellman’s (Tamsen McDonough) 5-year-old son Jacob (Ian Ho). Once there, Ms Zellman hands Kelly a long list of dos and don'ts for her kid, who just doesn’t go to sleep that easily. Turns out, little Jacob is special and the evil monster Grand Guignol wants to steal his bad dreams to create a nightmare army and take over the world. Also, he’s not alone. He has these tiny weird looking creatures ‘Toadies’ working for him, who kidnap Jacob. But just as Kelly is trying to reach the police, Liz (Oona Laurence) from a global secret babysitter society comes to her rescue. Thus begins the bizarre adventure of busting the monster hideout and rescuing Jacob.



Based on Joe Ballarini’s three-part book trilogy of the same name, this one’s far less haunting than the title suggests. Sure, the plot is novel for the genre but also predictable. It’s all fun and light even when Tom Felton is trying his best to scare us and the kids with all his teeth-clinching and evil laughter. He manages to scare no one. His sidekicks ‘Toadies’ fare much better. They are cute, in a weird way and it’s a treat to watch their goofy antics. We wish they had more screen time because there is just so much potential to have a lot more fun with them.



Director Rachel Talalay vividly brings to life the unreal world of monsters and teenage heroes with a pop of colour and grand imaginative set pieces. Too much CGI is a dampener in some of the scenes. The Halloween night only serves as a backdrop but the narrative moves away from that with Kelly and Liz fighting subtly spooky creatures like the ‘shadow monster.’



A promising Tamara Smart is clearly the life of the film as the wide-eyed teenager on an unexpected adventure. She is believable and quite in control of the goings-on with good support from Oona Laurence as the feisty bike riding babysitter Liz. Rest of the teenage actors are just about average, but performances of the adult cast are a hamfest. Together, they’re all in service of a strictly workable script that doesn’t even attempt to go beyond the basic fleshing out of its key characters.



‘A Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting’ doesn’t quite live up to its monstrous expectations but manages to deliver a mildly entertaining fare with a few laughs. Watch it for the child in you.

Exclusive!

Aditya Dhar: The pressure pushes me to go beyond what has been seen and done,,"As an introverted guy, filmmaker Aditya Dhar , who won a national award for his very first directorial, Uri: The Surgical Strike, had no qualms staying indoors during the national lockdown that lasted a few months. Even as the lockdown has been eased out in phases, the writer-director does not believe in stepping out of his house unless unavoidable.Talking about it, Aditya says, “I am not the hang-out type. The best place to be for me is my house. I love being home and that has been the case with me for over a decade now, since the time I moved to Mumbai. I like working in seclusion and solitude. I got a lot of that during the lockdown; it’s almost as if I was prepping for this for 12 years. I stayed home and I revisited a lot of my other screenplays that I had written over the years while learning the ropes of cinema. I could rework some of them. Those stories, in fact, helped me space out the work I was doing on Ashwatthama . You need to take a break to regain objectivity. I also cooked a lot. I’m a hotel management graduate, so I put that training to good use while at home. I also watched some of the content I had missed watching in the last two-three years because I was caught up. Being in lockdown had its benefits for me. I made it a point to avoid morose and dark content. Another learning that came out of lockdown is that there are so many more ways of making things work. I mean, I chatted with all my HODs from India and from the UK and the USA on zoom calls. The timings were a little off but it saved us a lot of time and energy. One does not need to be in the same room to make plans. You need to be on the same page. Over the years, I have seen this in our industry that people travel hours to say two important lines in a meeting that lasts hours with a lot of random topics being discussed. Efficient use of time and place is what this lockdown has taught people.”Despite the lockdown, the talk around Ashwatthama refused to drown out. The film has already become talk of town with the kind of scale and story that it promises to bring to the table. When asked about that, Aditya says, “We have a strong villain and a powerful leading lady in the film apart from Ashwatthama. I have always believed that the greater the opponent and the tougher the conflict, the more effective the story looks. To answer your question, I enjoy this pressure. It pushes me to do better. If there was no expectation from the film, one would not have the reason to push oneself. The pressure pushes me to go beyond what has been seen and done.”"
Tusshar: We would love to put out Golmaal editions for as long as people love them,,"Actor-producer Tusshar has been a part of the Golmaal family since 2006 when the first of the outings in the series was released. In almost 15 years, the franchise has had four films and talk is that the fifth outing is already being written by director-screenwriter Farhad Samji and should get underway in a few months. Filmmaker Rohit Shetty , who flagged off the series, will be back to doing what he does best - entertain the audience thoroughly with his fun bunch of characters. When the time is right, Tusshar, Shreyas Talpade Arshad Warsi and Kunal Kemmu will regroup for a dollop of fun. Arshad, in his last chat with Bombay Times, had mentioned the kind of energy the group shares, where narrations and readings are for enjoyment more than work.Talking about Golmaal, Tusshar says, “There was an announcement for Golmaal 5 and hopefully we will make that film. I really don’t know when, but it will happen for sure. It is more like the film has become a part of popular culture today. The family audience looks forward to a good laugh for two hours in a cinema hall. We would love to put out Golmaal for as long as people love it and want it. So, as for the fifth edition, the producers can tell you the timeline and when to expect it.”Elaborating on the journey the franchise has made so far, the actor-filmmaker says, “We took one step at a time. The first edition came out when times had just begun to change and the way films were being made and consumed had begun to shift. Multiplexes were a new concept then and catering to the audience there was a new task. We wanted to do a youth, massy film. Golmaal in its first edition set a high benchmark for us. It’s counted among cult comedies for a reason. When we made the film, we had no clue how it would do at the box office. Gradually, the outcome encouraged the next three outings in the line. With all the hard work that Rohit Shetty does for this franchise, I think he is the most satisfied with the outcome of his hardwork - a rollicking franchise that’s also proven its commercial worth over years.”"

"Exclusive! 20 Years of 'Mohabbatein': ""I am 48 now and don't mind playing father to anyone,"" says Jugal Hansraj",,"Jugal Hansraj Duration - 25:39 min Listen x

People talk quite a bit about Jugal Hansraj - the endlessly cute boy from 'Masoom'- but a lot of people don't know whether he's in India or abroad. Well, he's currently settled in the States and was happy to reminisce his journey in Bollywood in an exclusive interaction with ETimes. We reached out to him and quizzed him over a set of questions ranging from 'Mohabbatein' (which has completed 20 years today) to what he's doing next in life. Excerpts from the conversation:Well, firstly let me tell you that today is a day of double significance to me. 'Mohabbatein' released on this day 20 years ago, but I also released my directorial debut 'Roadside Romeo' on this very date (in 2008).I knew about this film. I knew Aditya Chopra was making it. Uday is a very good friend of mine and Aditya Chopra had tested him and found him very suitable for the role he did. I was very excited about my friend getting the part, which is when Aditya Chopra told me that there was a role for which he wanted me. I jumped at the idea. There was Mr Bachchan, there was SRK, there was Yash Raj. What more could I've asked for?Absolutely! Jimmy (Sheirgill) had done 'Maachis' by then and a music video with Manmohan Singhji as well. I had several films as a child artiste and had 3-4 movies as a lead to my credit. But, I felt I should restart. Aditya and I were on the same page regarding this. Thus, the preparation started. And mind you, the full prep was so immense and thrilling that it still holds us in good stead. Additional training should always be welcome. We had six months to ourselves for rehearsals, using video cameras to perform songs and scenes from other films. Tarun Mansukhani and Nikkhil Advani- now both accomplished directors- used to handle us; they were working as Assistant Editors on 'Mohabbatein'.We needed physical training as well. Jimmy Shergill, Uday and I were all around 27 but we had to look 19-years-old. We were given a short haircut. I did a lot of jogging to lose some weight. We ensured that we slept well. Jimmy had to do lots of gymming as he needed to have a certain athletic-type of talk and walk. We underwent workshops with Barry John and that was a learning experience which I use even today. And not to forget, the dance classes with Farah Khan's assistants. I had worked with Basu Chatterjee ('Gudgudee') and Mahesh Bhatt ('Papa Kehte Hai') before ‘Mohabbatein’, that experience had its own charm but was very informal. Like, Basuda for one, would tell me to wear whatever I wanted to.I can't pinpoint one, but people like my scene where I tell a poem to Kim Sharma.'Aaja Nachle' released in 2007, by then I had started my pre-production for 'Roadside Romeo'. So, I declined quite a few films during that period. I wanted to concentrate on 'RR' as it was an animation film and it required me to be hands-on. Three months before 'RR', Uday had started writing a film of his own. He used to call me every evening and we discussed about one scene every day, over a cup of tea. It was 'Pyaar Impossible'. When 'RR' was close to release, he asked me if I would like to direct it as we both had discussed so much on it and were on the same page, plus even I felt that I would be able to handle it. Two years rolled by while directing 'RR'.After that, I was supposed to act in quite a few films but for some reason they didn't take off. And, I was also going to direct a film for Excel Entertainment; Farhan Akhtar was very kicked about it but there was some issue on the rights of that film as it was a remake of an European movie. Then I was supposed to direct a film for Ashutosh Gowariker but that didn't happen as it fell into some trouble with the financers. However, I did a few TV projects, with Pradeep Sarkar for one. And then in 2014, I took up a creative position at Dharma Productions to develop content.In 2016, 'Kahaani 2' came to me and I found it very exciting. Actually, Sujoy Ghosh had even offered me one of his earlier films, 'Jhankaar Beats'. I was a bit apprehensive about taking up 'Kahaani 2' as it was a negative portrayal but Sujoy Ghosh put me at ease when he narrated it to me fully. It was great to work with Sujoy Ghosh and Vidya Balan Post that, I was offered a lot of TV but I didn't take it up as I hadn't enjoyed my TV stint that I had earlier. Plus, shooting 10-12 scenes in a day was not too much to my liking and so I politely turned them down.I am very proud of 'RR' as it went on to fetch three national awards. It was the first animation film produced in India. It still gives me goosebumps when I see the Walt Disney logo on it. I am equally proud of 'Pyaar Impossible'. Priyanka Chopra was wonderful to work with, so punctual and such a team player, she went out of the way to help us, she's one of the most professional actors that I have dealt with in any capacity.Yes, I wrote 'Cross Connection'. It so happened that 'Cross Connection' was supposed to be another animation film from me with Walt Disney and Yash Raj Films. They had approved the story and I had even written its first draft. But something went wrong in the joint venture between YRF and Walt Disney and that business partnership broke up. This was before I directed 'Pyaar Impossible' for YRF.However, I wanted to tell the 'Cross Connection' story and decided to rewrite it as a novel, devoting two hours to it every day. That, in fact, went on to make me write another book, inspired from a line in Buddhism- 'A sword is useless in the form of a coward'. Harper Collins liked it and agreed to publish it. I am honoured and looking forward to releasing my second book sometime in April 2021.Not really, but I am only in touch with Shekhar Kapoor once in a while. He is a very warm person and I respect him a lot. We don't talk on a regular basis but I am very fond of him. There's a certain gut connection with Shekhar especially for the way he treated all the three kids - myself, Urmila Matondkar and Aradhana Srivastav, with so much love and affection. I do bump into Naseerji and Shabanaji at functions if and when I'm in Mumbai. There's too much fondness for them too, they are such stalwarts.You can't call it the future. It's very much the present. It's giving certain filmmakers the freedom to tell their stories which they might not have been able to, owing to certain commercial compulsions in the feature film medium. But cinemas are not going anywhere. OTT has just helped the audience base to increase exponentially. Stars would definitely like to return on the big screen, once the pandemic has run its course. Yes, I am developing some content for OTT but it's too early to talk about it.I shifted base to the US about three years ago, after the birth of my son. My wife (Jasmine Dhillon) is working here. I was also anchoring a long-running TV show here. I was also in talks with one offer to act and another to direct. But I shuttle a lot and often come to India. The on-going pandemic has put a pause on certain things, though.I am open to working in Bollywood films as well, depending upon the script, director and my role- in that order. Like in 'Kahaani 2' I had just seven scenes but for me the part was so integral to the plot.I am 48 now, so I don't mind playing father to anyone. Playing father to what age would depend on how good the script is."

NEW DELHI: Halfway through, the festive season is acting as a ray of hope for the auto industry. From Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai to luxury players like BMW and Mercedes-Benz , the initial period of festivities augered healthy sales and for some, the current numbers outperformed previous years.With several festive choices to pick from, the SUV segment in particular has been witnessed significant demand. The B-segment SUVs, a busy playing field, packs heavyweights like Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza and Hyundai Venue. Our attention, however, is towards the newcomers and their USPs.The indication has been clear and loud towards the popular choice Kia Sonet , Toyota and Nissan’s B-segment debutants. We talk about the X-factors of each car and the little extras that you get with each B-SUV.There is a lot of expectation around this upcoming ‘almost-Indian’ Japanese car as Nissan is moving to a whole new era with the all-new Magnite.This feature is the first-in-segment and definitely puts the Magnite ahead of the competition. The drivers will be able to see a bird’s eye view of the car making complex parallel and perpendicular parking quite easy. This feature in India is quite helpful because cluttered urban spaces are now a common sight to see.Magnite offers a huge ‘couple distance’ (distance between the driver and side passenger) of 700mm with a rear knee room of 593mm and rear headroom of 76mm. This is the most Indian thing about B-SUV as it doesn’t compromise with space and can accommodate an extra passenger or two above the capacity if the need ever arises.Magnite is powered by Nissan Intelligent Mobility (NIM) offering driver-centric features. The all-new HRA0 1.0-litre turbo engine, with the ‘mirror bore cylinder coating’ from GT-R, is claimed to be quite refined and smoother than most of the rivals. The welcome animation and voice recognition are icing on the cake.Kia is destined to break records, and quite aptly Sonet and Seltos have been formed such an opinion. The Korean SUV has appealed everybody with its performance on-road and in the market.Offered by a few other cars in the Indian market, this feature reflects the premium-ness of this B-SUV. Both the front seats get this feature to give an exceptionally comfortable in-cabin experience.This feature is a segment-first and the Sonet is the only car to offer it as standard. When it comes to dealing with the highly unpredictable Indian traffic, this feature makes sure that the entertainment is top-notch even if the drives last for hours.This feature is slowly becoming a must-have in India and the Sonet is the only car with an inbuilt unit. With AQI (air-quality-index) reading with HEPA filtration, the in-car experience is way ahead of the curve.With 2 petrol engines and a diesel engine being offered, customers have quite the options to choose from according to their needs and lifestyle. Sonet’s boot at 390 litres is the largest in the segment. Not just parking, but on the move, the rear view monitor shows what trails the SUV.The rebadged version of the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza is eyeing to create similar magic like its twin. But has it got enough?The Fortuner has been a dream car for many but it definitely is not a budget-friendly car. The Urban Cruiser acts as a good and affordable entry-level substitute and looks quite good as it borrows its looks from the iconic SUV.Toyota is a trusted carmaker and has been known for its exceptional aftersales services. The Urban Cruiser is a perfect example of that commitment. The B-SUV comes with one of the best-in-segment warranties of 3 years/1,00,000 km.The Urban Cruiser offers a fresh dual-tone dark brown interior that which is not offered by its Maruti Suzuki twin. The borrowed features like mild-hybrid tech, engine, and a few comfort and convenience offerings suit this B-SUV well too."
Volkswagen launches enhanced app for in-car assistance,,"NEW DELHI: Volkswagen India on Tuesday launched the upgraded My Volkswagen Connect assistant to offer a much more secured and enhanced in-car experience. The smart assistant records, protects and analyzes the data.The new My Volkswagen Connect feature comes as standard in the Polo GT TSI and the Vento Highline Plus The new assistant comes with features like real time location, towing alert, geo-fencing, route deviation alert, SOS call and many more.My Volkswagen Connect assistant sports a simple and easy user interface which can be accessed by plugging the dongle to the on-board diagnostics (OBD) port of the car. It can be paired to any Android or iOS device after a secure OTP exchange.The app also enables customers to locate point of interest and also to reach out to customer care or road side assistance, in case of emergencies. Additionally, customers can also use the app to scan, upload and store critical vehicular documents or related official documents for a paperless experience. Customers can also use the app to set renewal reminders for vehicle insurance and receive ‘over the air’ (OTA) software update.Currently, the smart assistant is available with 3 years of free subscription and 3 years of warranty.“We introduced the upgraded ‘My Volkswagen Connect’ app that offers customer convenience and safety at their fingertips. Customers will have access to real time vehicle analysis and assistance that would make them aware of their vehicle condition, driving patterns and enhance the overall fun-to-drive experience that a Volkswagen stands for,” said Steffen Knapp , Director, VPCI."

IPL 2020 Playoffs: Here are each IPL team's chances of making it to the last four,,"1. The maximum any team can reach this season in the league stage is 20 points

2. Only three teams can reach this –

Mumbai Indians

,

Delhi Capitals

and

Royal Challengers Bangalore

3. If one of these three teams gets to 20 points, the other two can’t

4. With 11 games in all left to be played in the league stage, there are 2,048 possible combinations of match outcomes (not counting washouts)

5. In 512 of these possible combinations, Chennai Super Kings get to 12 points. In none of them, however, can they qualify since at least four teams will get to 14 or more points

6. Chennai are therefore out of contention even if they win all their remaining games

7.

Rajasthan Royals

are only slightly better off. If they lose even one of their remaining two games, they cannot qualify. If they win both, they have a 9% chance of being tied on points for fourth place (48 out of 512 possible outcomes)

8. Sunrisers Hyderabad’s chances of qualifying for the play-offs also remain slim even if they win their remaining three games. If they do that, they have a 10% chance of being tied for fourth place (26 out of 256 possible outcomes)

9. Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore have a 95% chance of qualifying

10. The chances of any of these teams failing to qualify because they can’t even make joint fourth spot is a mere 0.4%. The probability of any of them ending up in tied fourth place is 4.7%

11. Kolkata Knight Riders and Kings XI are therefore the most likely contenders for the fourth spot

12. There is a very slim chance (0.4%) of KKR finishing clearly at the top with 18 points. It has a 6% chance of tying for first place

13. Kings XI has no chance of being a clear No.1, but there is a slim chance (0.4%) of it being tied for first place

With Chennai Super Kings clearly out of the race, what exactly are the chances of the remaining seven teams to make it to the playoffs? TOI's Shankar Raghuraman does the number crunching to arrive at these 13 points.The IPL 2020 season has been a very competitive one. With a team like Kings XI Punjab rising from the ashes after languishing at the bottom of the points table, thanks to four wins on the trot, things have become more interesting. The three break away teams this season have been Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore. Mumbai and Bangalore though both lost over the weekend. With seven teams in the running for the four play-offs berths and three teams (Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore) more than likely to seal a spot, the fight for the remaining fourth place (for which KKR and KXIP are the prime contenders as of now) could make the remaining league matches of IPL 2020 very interesting. Expect the teams to throw everything, including the kitchen sink to try and grab a play-off berth in the matches coming up."

DUBAI: Wriddhiman Saha stamped his class with a 45-ball 87 before Rashid Khan dished out a clinical bowling performance as Sunrisers Hyderabad kept themselves alive in the race for IPL play-offs with a whopping 88-run win over Delhi Capital on Tuesday.Asked to bat first, splendid knocks by Saha (87), skipper David Warner (66) and Manish Pandey (44) powered Sunrisers to 219 for two.Star spinner Rashid then led a fine bowling display to end with the impressive figures of 4-0-7-3, his best in this season.The Afghan bowled an astonishing 17 dot balls in his quota of four overs, helping his side bowl out the Capitals for 131 in 19 overs.Sunrisers (10 points) have now moved up to sixth from seventh position with this win, while the Capitals, who slumped to their third consecutive loss, were pushed down to the third spot with 14 points.Chasing a stiff target, it was a rather ordinary performance by the the Capitals batsmen. Shikhar Dhawan (0) and Marcus Stoinis (5), who was elevated to number 3, perished in the first two overs.Ajinkya Rahane (26) and Shimron Heytmyer (16) quickly started the recovery work, stitching a 40 run stand, the highest for their team. The duo targeted Jason Holder, collecting 22 runs in the sixth over as Delhi reached 54 for two at the end of the Powerplay overs.However, Rashid dealt Delhi with twin blows, getting rid of both Rahane and Hetmyer in the seventh over. Skipper Shreyas Iyer (7) was next to depart as wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals.Seven of Delhi's batsmen failed to reach double digits with Rishabh Pant (36) being the top scorer.While Rashid was the pick of the bowlers for Sunrisers, Sandeep Sharma (2/27) and T Natarajan (2/26) picked two wickets apiece. Vijay Shankar(1/11), Shahbaz Nadeem (1/8), Holder (1/46) took a wicket each.Earlier, both openers Warner, who looked in good nick, and Saha, playing his second game of the season, went after the Delhi bowlers from the word go.Fully capitalising on the field restrictions, the duo smashed boundaries (11 fours and two sixes) every over to collect 77-runs in the first six overs, the best Poweplay figures of the season.In the sixth over, Warner smashed the tournament's leading wicket-taker Kagiso Rabada (0/54) for four boundaries and a six, helping the Sunrisers reach 100 runs in just 8.4 overs.Till Warner was taking on the bowlers, Saha played the second fiddle to perfection.The Australian celebrated his 34th birthday with a half-century off just 25 balls, hitting two sixes and eight fours at the Dubai International Stadium.To Delhi's relief Ravichandran Ashwin (1/35) broke the 107-run opening stand in the 10th over as he dismissed danger man Warner, who was caught at extra cover by Axar Patel.With Warner gone, Saha hammered the Capitals bowlers all around the park. The wicketkeeper batsman reached his fifty in style with a boundary. He plundered 12 fours and two sixes before pacer Anrich Nortje (1/37) dismissed him in the 15th over.Pandey and Kane Williamsion (11 not out) continued the assault on a listless Delhi bowling unit."
World 100m champion Coleman to miss Olympics after being banned for whereabouts failure,,"The Disciplinary Tribunal has upheld the AIU’s charge and banned sprinter Christian Coleman of the USA for 2 years… https://t.co/7OABpEtwx2 — Athletics Integrity Unit (@aiu_athletics) 1603819353000

World 100 metres champion Christian Coleman will miss next year's Tokyo Olympics after being banned for two years for breaching whereabouts rules, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) said on Tuesday.Coleman, who narrowly escaped a ban last year for missing three doping tests, was provisionally suspended by the AIU in June.The American sprinter had claimed at the time that anti-doping officials had not followed procedure when he missed them after going Christmas shopping on Dec. 9, 2019 at a time when he had said he would be at home.Doping control officers testified before a disciplinary tribunal that they were present during the whole of the allotted hour of 7:15 pm to 8:15 pm on Dec. 9 in front of Coleman's house.Coleman in turn testified that he had arrived home from Christmas shopping shortly before the end of the one-hour period.However, shopping receipts showed that Coleman had purchased 16 items from a Walmart Supercenter at 8:22 pm, the AIU said.""We do not accept the Athlete's evidence,"" the AIU added in a statement on its website. ""It is obvious that in fact the athlete did not go home until after making his 8:22 pm purchase. We are comfortably satisfied that this is what happened.""The AIU added that Coleman's ban would end on May 13, 2022 and that he could appeal the tribunal's decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport .Three failures to properly file whereabouts information or being absent during the hour stated in a 12-month period can result in a one- or two-year suspension.Coleman, also a silver medallist in the 100m and 4x100m relay at the 2017 worlds, escaped suspension last year when the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), after receiving guidance from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on how to calculate the 12-month window for three missed tests, withdrew the charge.The sprinter, who also helped the United States to 4x100m gold at the 2019 worlds in Doha, later demanded an apology from USADA, but two of those misses have now combined with the latest failure to result in a ban."
Djokovic wins Vienna opener to move closer to Sampras record,,"Novak Djokovic. (Reuters Photo)

VIENNA: Novak Djokovic defeated Filip Krajinovic in the first round in Vienna on Tuesday to edge closer to Pete Sampras's all-time record of ending the year as world number one on six occasions.

Djokovic beat compatriot Krajinovic 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 and needs to win his next match in Austria against Borna Coric to ensure he equals the achievement of his childhood idol.

The 33-year-old Serb has been the top-ranked player at the end of a season five times: in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2018.

He shares that mark with career rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal .

Sampras achieved the feat six years in succession between 1993 and 1998.

Djokovic was playing in Vienna for the first time since he won the title there in 2007, and dropped serve twice in a tricky opening set.

Krajinovic served for the first set at 5-4 and then held a set point in the tie-break but couldn't take advantage.

A couple of breaks in the second set allowed Djokovic to clinch victory -- his 38th in 40 matches this year.

""First set, I think he was the better player. He was serving for the first set and I was lucky. He missed a smash at 6/6 in the tie-break,"" said Djokovic.

""A few points here and there can change the momentum of the match. In the second set, I stepped it up, I played better and I am just pleased with the way I finished the match.""

The 17-time Grand Slam title winner is appearing at his first tournament since his heavy loss to Nadal in the Roland Garros final two weeks ago.

Djokovic is also attempting to beat Federer's all-time best of 310 weeks spent on top of the rankings.

On Monday, Djokovic began his 292nd week in total as world number one.

Djokovic and US Open winner Dominic Thiem are two of six top 10 players in the draw in the Austrian capital.

BLOG | SCORECARD

SUNRISERS HYDERABAD THRASH DELHI CAPITALS BY 88 RUNS

Rashid Khan (Sunrisers Hyderabad):

The ball came out nicely, but we won the game more importantly. The wicket was helping a lot. The more you bowl in the right areas. To bowl economically is what I am focusing on, whether I get wickets or not... I focus on bowling dot balls and it helps me get wickets and also helps to take wickets at the other end. I just go with a clear mind. I never think about the scoreboard, what the target is, what;s a good score if we bowl first. I always think I should bowl in the right areas. As long as you bowl there you can trouble anyone. You got to play with the batsman's mind. Keep mixing it up seeing what the batsman is trying to do.

Shreyas Iyer (Delhi Capitals):

Definitely a big loss for us but you can't really bog down from this point of time. We still have two games left but one win is really important, that's what we are waiting for since the last three games. Back-to-back losses is definitely going to put us under the pump. The boys are really strong, really motivated and this loss is definitely going to motivate us. We lost the game in the powerplay itself. Getting 70 runs in the first six overs was really commendable and the way they went after our bowlers was amazing. We need to have that strong and positive mindset. These losses are not going to put us down. As a team, we have been doing amazing throughout so these few matches shouldn't get into our heads. Next match, we'll see to it that we have done our studies right, we'll also see to it that we are putting in our best efforts on the field. It's really difficult to judge what to do on this wicket because it keeps changing any time, so the best thing is to lose the toss. I was contemplating whether to bat or to bowl, unfortunately I won the toss (laughs). We decided that the dew factor will play a massive role, but the ball was stopping a bit. It was really difficult to get off to a great start.

CAPTAINS' TAKE:

David Warner (SRH):

I was actually looking to bat first. (on his birthday celebration) I can't understand this cake-in-the face business (laughs), it's quite messy. It was disappointing to lose that last game with a lot of wickets in hand.

Shreyas Iyer (DC):

We'll bowl first. The wicket looks dry and the dew factor coming in later is a factor. That (the trends) definitely goes into our mind but we were constantly batting first in the early part of the tournament. But the wickets have become drier and that's affected our plans. We want to end up in the top-two, and the boys are really motivated. After some bad performances, we sat together and talked about where we went wrong. Same team.

TOSS: Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer wins toss, opts to field against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

"Sancho's poor form due to Manchester United talk, says Dortmund coach",,"Jadon Sancho. ( AFP Photo)

BERLIN: Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said Tuesday that the recent transfer speculation linking Jadon Sancho to Manchester United is behind the England winger's dip in form.

""Every player has slow periods. There was a lot of talk about Jadon during the summer -- something like that can be a factor,"" Favre said ahead of Dortmund's Champions League home game against Zenit Saint Petersburg on Wednesday.

Throughout the summer, until the transfer window closed on October 5, the British media speculated that Man United were set to sign Sancho.

In late September, Dortmund reportedly rejected United's offer of up to 100 million euros ($117 million).

So far in 2020/21, the 20-year-old has struggled to recapture last season's blistering form when he scored 17 goals and created just as many in the Bundesliga.

However, Sancho struggled in Dortmund's shock 2-0 league defeat by Augsburg in late September and was then dropped by England for breaching coronavirus protocols on international duty earlier this month.

Sancho was also off form in a poor team display when Dortmund lost 3-1 at Lazio last week in the Champions League.

However, he produced a superb pass to Erling Braut Haaland, who scored in Saturday's 3-0 league drubbing of Schalke in the Ruhr derby.

Favre says Sancho just needs time.

""No player is consistently in top form for an entire year, that's impossible. You have to accept that,"" added the Dortmund boss.

Dortmund are looking to get back on track in Group F against Zenit after crashing in Rome.

Zenit are also hoping to bounce back from a poor opening 2-1 loss at home to Club Brugge.

""It wasn't a good enough performance against Lazio,"" admitted Dortmund midfielder Thomas Delaney.

""Fortunately, there are still more chances to pick up points. I'm not worried that we won't qualify.""

The same is going to happen this year after concerns over Chennai Super Kings' readiness were erased with their first practice session in Dubai on Friday.CSK were the last franchise to hit the nets after clearing final rounds of COVID-19 testing.Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and all other CSK players, except for the COVID-19 afflicted duo of Deepak Chahar and Ruturaj Gaikwad, started training on Friday.With Deepak and Ruturaj testing positive last week along with 11 members of the CSK contingent, the team was forced to delay its training plan after completing the six-day quarantine, including three tests, upon arrival on August 21.The virus free players had to undergo three additional tests before beginning their training on Friday. The infected players are in 14-day quarantine.This year's IPL was originally scheduled to be held from March 29 to May 24 but was postponed barely two weeks before the start of the tournament due to the coronavirus outbreak.Then, as the number of cases increased, the league was indefinitely postponed but the postponement of the T20 World Cup cleared the decks for the league to take place in the September-November window."

"Uddhav Thackeray: Try and topple my govt if you have the courage, Uddhav Thackeray dares BJP",,"MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday launched a blistering attack on the BJP , questioning the Hindutva of “clanging bells and utensils”, and daring the Modi regime to topple his government.

“Since the day I became the CM, I have been hearing different dates on the toppling of my government. So far it hasn’t happened… if you have the courage… then go ahead and do it,” said Thackeray who heads a Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance in the state. He will complete a year in office on November 28.

Thackeray was addressing the party’s annual Dussehra rally from the Veer Savarkar auditorium in Shivaji Park with limited attendance. The rally was shifted indoors keeping the Covid safety protocol in mind.

In a no-holds-barred attack on the BJP in his Dussehra rally speech, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said at a time when the country was in the grips of a pandemic, “a peculiar thing is happening”, the Centre’s focus is on toppling governments in non-BJP ruled states. The nation is on the verge of chaos because of the BJP’s unbridled greed for power, he said, “They (the BJP) have been deceiving their partners. The NDA is finished. They talk of friendship and later stab their friends in the back. They will treat Nitish Kumar in a similar fashion after the assembly polls in Bihar.”

The chief minister, targeted by the BJP for not re-opening places of worship, said Sena’s Hindutva was not confined to the symbolism of cymbals and lamps. “Trouncing terrorists is the Sena’s idea of Hindutva,” he declared.

Thackeray quoted from Mohan Bhagwat’s Dussehra speech in which the RSS Sar Sanghchalak said praying in temples or performing poojas should not be equated with Hindutva. “All those writing letters to me should pay heed to Bhagwat first,” he said in a not-so-oblique reference to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s recent letter in which he questioned the Sena’s commitment to Hindutva while demanding that places of worship be re-opened.

Thackeray also slammed the BJP over its free vaccine promise to people of Bihar if it retained power. “You are talking about giving free vaccines in Bihar. Is the rest of the country a part of Pakistan or Bangladesh?” Thackeray asked.

Referring to the Sushant Singh Rajput case, Thackeray said that those “crying for justice for Bihar’s son” are “indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra’s son, ( Aaditya Thackeray ) and the Mumbai police.”

“A lot of mudslinging was on the government, on our family and even on Aaditya. However, since we were clean we didn’t have to worry, but those indulging in these tricks stink of the cow’s urine,” said Thackeray.

The CM said the Modi government hasn’t helped the state financially despite several natural disasters since June, and has also not paid Rs 38,000 crore worth of GST dues to the state. He urged CMs of all states to sink party differences and exert pressure on the Centre to undertake a comprehensive review of GST.

“When they were introducing GST we were opposed to it. It is a flawed system. I appeal to CMs of other states to come ahead for a discussion on the issue. GST should be scrapped if it is not working, and the earlier tax collection system regime should be revived,” he said.

Thackeray said in the recent past many have tried to defame the state and city. “Someone said Mumbai is like PoK… they come to Mumbai for work and then defame the city. This amounts to namak harami,” said Thackeray without naming Kangana Ranaut. “A narrative has been painted to show that the entire city and the state is a drug haven. Everyone here is a drug addict. Any attempt to defame Mumbai and the state will be dealt with strictly,” said Thackeray.

"Narendra Modi: Think of troops at borders, light a ‘diya’ for them",,"NEW DELHI: At a time when India and China are facing off on the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday exhorted people to light a ‘diya’ in their homes in support of security forces guarding India’s borders.“We must also think of our braveheart soldiers who are firmly stationed on our borders in the line of duty, even during these festive times, all in the service and security of Mother India. We have to light a ‘diya’ (lamp) at home in honour of these brave sons and daughters of Mother India,” Modi said.In his monthly radio address Mann ki Baat ’, Modi also made a strong pitch for unity. “Unity is power, unity is strength, unity is progress, unity is empowerment, united we will scale new heights,” he said.The PM also said India has repeatedly thwarted efforts of those who have sought to divide the country.Promoting ‘Vocal for Local’ while shopping during the festival season, the PM said people should make an effort to involve sanitation workers, security guards, domestic helps and other service staff in family celebrations to send out a message that their services are valued. He also sought people’s engagement in the government’s ‘Ek Bharat-Shrestha Bharat’ by contributing information about India’s rich tradition of local cuisines, spices and indigenous ingredients.In light of the coronavirus pandemic , the PM emphasised the need for care and caution during the festival season and asked people to remain patient and follow health guidelines.During his radio broadcast, Modi also lauded Pon Mariyappan from Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu for converting a small portion of his hair cutting salon into a library, and hailed similar mobile library initiatives in UP and Arunachal Pradesh."

The next government will be a Nitish free government.”Paswan took another swipe at Bihar CM Nitish Kumar by referring to a full page advertisement of BJP with only the PM’s photograph. Though the advertisement had the symbols of all four parties in the NDA, Paswan said, “I am happy that BJP’s advertisement has only the PM’s photograph. My BJP friends have realised that putting Nitish Kumar’s photograph is causing harm.”BJP leaders have said Paswan was trying to create confusion and the saffron party had no ties with the regional outfit. LJP has put up 138 candidates and 122 of them are against JD(U) and its ally, Jitin Ram Manjhi’s HAM. It has very few nominees against BJP."
Ajit Pawar-led co-op bank sold mill to kin at a discount: ED,,"MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) says it has found transactions which establish that members of deputy CM Ajit Pawar ’s family bankrolled a bid to purchase a sugar mill at a discount when it was put up for auction by the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB) while he was its director.MSCB auctioned the mill in 2010 at a “throwaway price” to a bidder who received funds from a company owned by Pawar’s maternal uncle, which in turn had received Rs 20 crore from a firm where Ajit Pawar’s wife was a director, the ED said. It flagged this conflict of interest before a special court while opposing closure of the MSCB case involving loans to sugar mills that were written off.The ED has, in an application before a special court on Tuesday, intervened and opposed a closure report filed by Mumbai police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) after looking at large loans to sugar mills which were written off by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB).The ED cited a Bombay HC order that found material evidence disclosing ‘cognizable offence’. The EOW has opposed the ED plea and said it did not have the locus standi to intervene and that the interference was unwarranted.The ED’s application cites bids placed by Ajit Pawar’s family to acquire sugar mills that were auctioned by the bank while he was its director. It has underlined this conflict of interest between Pawar’s role as an MSCB director and his family’s businesses in more than one instance.In the first case, Jarandeshwar Sugar Cooperative was acquired by a bidder who was financed by Pawar’s family, the agency said. The bidder later handed over the mill to a company owned by Pawar’s maternal uncle Rajendra Ghadge on lease, it added.In the second instance, when the bank auctioned the Kannad Sugar Cooperative mill, it was Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew Rohit Pawar’s company Baramati Agro which purchased it. There were two bidders shortlisted and the second bidder Hitech Engineering’s Rs 5-crore deposit for bid participation was funded by Baramati Agro, the ED said.The ED has also listed auctioning of five more sugar mills bought by different entities who paid money to the bank after a year. One of them paid the money after three years. All of them paid an initial 25% of the auction amount a month after the auction. The reserve prices for the auction was in the range of Rs 17-26 crore, but sale was concluded at lower rates in all five cases.On Tuesday along with the original complainant, businessman Surinder Mohan Arora , three members of sugar factories sold by MSC Bank, Shalinitai Patil, former MLA and widow of former state CM Vasantdada Patil, former NCP member and ex-MLA Manik Bhimrao Jadhav, and Kisan Kewad also filed protest petitions against EOW’s 70,000-page closure report.

"After cementing ties with US, India focuses on key European partners",,"<p>Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla (File photo)<br></p>

NEW DELHI: After high-level engagement with the US, India is turning attention to its key strategic partners in Europe. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla heads out on Thursday for London, Paris and Berlin, where he is expected to hold a wide range of consultations with foreign offices, parliamentarians and academia.

The idea, according to sources, is to restart intensive engagements in European capitals after over six months of Covid-imposed isolation.

In its second term, the Modi government has placed special emphasis on Europe for its foreign policy outreach. That was tested by the response to India’s decision to neuter Article 370 in J&K and the consequent imposition of restrictions in the Union Territory and detention of political leaders (particularly on the issue of human rights).

However, India has still to help shape the European view on a couple of key foreign policy and security issues — China and Indo-Pacific— while building up greater development and security relationships on defence, climate and energy. Covid has sharpened the need for closer cooperation on healthcare as well as global economic recovery post-pandemic, officials said.

The growing closeness between India and the US also means that New Delhi is taking a greater interest in transatlantic relations. The Trump Administration had an ‘onagain-off-again’ relationship with Europe, but a potential Biden Administration could recast the US-Europe relationship, opening up many more opportunities for India.

Shringla will address think tanks— Policy Exchange in London and IFRI in Paris— as part of his outreach, besides meeting business leaders in these nations.

From a virtually uncritical embrace of China, European countries have been nuancing their positions, particularly on the issue of technology access and 5G. From France to Poland, Sweden to UK, there is an open rejection of China’s Huawei for 5G. From France to Germany and UK, there is also a greater understanding and acceptance of the Indo-Pacific as a geo-political reality.

In the past few months, both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar have engaged with Europe virtually.

"Z+ cover based on threat, not paying capacity, says SC",,"Supreme Court of India (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a petition seeking withdrawal of Z-plus security cover to the Ambani brothers and their family members but frowned upon the Bombay High Court ’s view that police should provide high level security to those who perceived a threat to their life and were willing to pay for it.

A special leave petition by Himanshu Agarwal challenged a Bombay HC order dismissing his PIL, by which he had sought withdrawal of Z-plus security cover to the Ambani brothers and their family members on the ground that they were rich enough to arrange for their own security instead of the state providing it by spending from the public exchequer.

The HC had said, ""It is the duty of the state to ensure maintenance of law and order which includes providing security to such citizens who require the same to protect their lives. The revenue of Reliance Industries Limited corporation has a substantial impact on India's GDP. The threat perception of these private individuals cannot be lightly ignored to deny protection to their lives. Once a threat from (a) terrorist organisation has been found by the respondent state, private respondent's family members to have security protection of the highest category to protect their life and limb cannot be alleged as lacking in substance.""

Agarwal, through counsel Karan Bharihoke, told a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan , R S Reddy and M R Shah that extension of Z-plus security to private persons ""without any concrete proof of any real threat to them indicates an element of favouritism which is uncalled for, considering the fact that the same constituted a part of central government's resources”.

The bench looked for the state counsel but no one was present. Appearing for the respondents, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said there was a threat perception to the industrialists and their families. ""We are paying for the cost of security cover extended to us by the government,"" Rohatgi said. Bharihoke responded, ""It is a personal perception about threat to life. For the state to provide security cover, there has to be some reasonable relation between the threat and security cover.""

The bench asked, ""If any citizen perceives a threat to his life and is willing to bear the cost of the security cover, should the state provide it? When was the last time the threat perception to the respondent was reviewed by the state? We don't want to approve that the state should provide security cover to private individuals, if he/she has the capacity to pay for it.""

The bench dismissed the appeal, but said the state would periodically review the threat perception to the Ambanis and take appropriate measures towards providing them security. Rohatgi said the Ambanis were ready to pay for it. The bench said, ""We have no doubt you can pay for it.""

Four aides of Dawood Ibrahim -- Chhota Shakeel who looks after all criminal and underworld operations of D-Company; Mohammad Anis Shaikh who supplied arms, ammunition and hand grenades and was involved in 1993 blasts; Tiger Memon who hatched the 1993 blasts conspiracy; and Javed Chikna – figure in the updated list of designated terrorists .

Others in the list are 2002 Akshardham temple attack accused Farhatullah Ghori and Shahid Latif, JeM’s Commander of Sialkot sector involved in launching of JeM terrorists into India including those behind 2016 Pathankot attack.

Solar Eclipse/Surya Grahan: What is solar eclipse and how does it occur?,,"What is a solar eclipse?

A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon. What is a ‘Ring of Fire’ during solar eclipse?

We do not get to see a ‘Ring of Fire’ during all solar eclipses and those solar eclipses where a ‘Ring of Fire’ is visible is called an annular solar eclipse. During such an eclipse, the centre of the Sun is covered by the Moon in such a way that the outer edge of the Sun is left visible and it looks like a ring. When viewed from a long distance it looks like a ring of fire around the Moon called the 'annulus'. However, when an annular solar eclipse takes place, the ‘Ring of Fire’ is not visible from all places on earth. As a result of which the annular solar eclipse may look like a partial solar eclipse. When does an annular solar eclipse happen?

We do not get to see a 'ring of fire' during all solar eclipse. For an annular solar eclipse to take place, three things need to happen — there should be a New Moon, the Moon should be at or very near a lunar node so that the Sun, Moon and the Earth all are in a straight line and the Moon should be near the apogee (the farthest point of the Moon from Earth) so that the outer edge of the Sun is visible. The 'Ring of Fire' is visible only when all these three parameters are met. When will solar eclipse start on Wednesday

According to the India Meteorological Department’s Kolkata-based Positional Astronomy Centre, the solar eclipse will begin at 8am on Thursday. It will slowly increase in intensity before peaking two hours later. It will end at 1.35pm. Places where solar eclipse can be seen

In Delhi, the partial eclipse will begin at 8.17am while the greatest eclipse will start at 9.30. The partial eclipse will end at 10.56am and the total duration of the eclipse will be 2 hours and 39 minutes. The solar eclipse will be at its maximum intensity at 10.47am and will remain so for a little under four minutes. The eclipse will be visible in some parts of India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Sumatra, Australia, Philippines and Singapore. People living in Ooty, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Shivagange, Tiruchirappalli and Kasaragod will be able to see the “ring of fire”. However, residents of New Delhi, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Ludhiana and Agra will only witness a partial solar eclipse. “From India, annular phase will be visible in the morning after sunrise from some places within a narrow corridor of southern part of the country (parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and it will be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. The narrow corridor of annular phase of the eclipse will pass through the southern part of the country through certain places like Kannur, Coimbatore, Kozhikode, Madurai, Mangalore, Ooty, Tiruchirappalli, etc,” a bulletin of the Positional Astronomy Centre stated. Precautions while watching the solar eclipse

“The eclipse should not be viewed with the naked eye. It will cause permanent damage of the eyes even when the moon covers most portion of the sun. Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised Mylar, black polymer and welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the sun’s image on a white board by a telescope,” the bulletin stated. Dos and donts on solar eclipse

Exposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause “eclipse blindness” or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy, say opthalmologists. ""Radiation from the sun is so powerful that regular sunglasses or lens in cameras will not be able to filter,"" says senior opthalmologist Dr Mohan Rajan. ""Looking at the sun for more than 90 seconds exceeds threshold of retinal damage,"" he said. The harmful ultra violet rays from the sun can destroy cells in the retina that transmit what you see to the brain, sometimes causing permanent damage. Many times people it can occur without pain. ""Symptoms can take a few hours to a few days after viewing the solar eclipse to realize the damage that has occurred,"" he said. Many experience loss of central vision (solar retinopathy) , distorted vision or altered color vision. Do not watch the eclipse on * Smartphone * Camera viewfinder, telescope or binoculars * Unsafe filters or glasses. Dos Use specifically designed for viewing a solar eclipse. Follow directions to use carefully

NEW DELHI: Several parts of the country, including Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi, are witnessing a solar eclipse on Thursday morning, which is said to the last one of the decade.The solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, began at around 8:17 am and will continue till 10:57 am today. It is also being referred to as ""ring of fire"" and "" Surya Grahan "" in Hindi.The beginning of the eclipse can be first seen from the Arabian sea coast of Oman at around 7:59 hours IST and the annular eclipse will become first visible in west of Baharain at 09:06 hours IST, Duari added.

What is NPR: All you need to know about National Population Register that could pave way for pan-India NRC,,"What is NPR?

The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more. What is its purpose?

NPR's purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. What are the demographic details required?

Name of person Relationship to head of household, Father’s name, Mother’s name, Spouse’s name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification. What is the current status?

Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government. Which states have blocked NPR?

The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, ""All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal."" Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record 'basic information' on citizens. ""After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC,"" the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week. Why is Assam excluded

As of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens. How can NPR data be accessed

NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.

NEW DELHI: Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved funds to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register ( NPR ), officials have said.The NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of ""usual residents"" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed.Meanwhile, the Left parties announced a seven-day nationwide protest from January 1 to 7 and a general strike on January 8 against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC .In a joint statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party said the protest programme was announced in solidarity with the trade unions, which have also called a general strike on January 8.Now it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam."
All you need to know about National Register of Citizens of India,,"What is NRC ( National Register of Citizens )?

NRC means the National Register of Citizens. NRC is a list of Assam's residents – prepared to identify bonafide residents and deport illegal migrants in the northeastern state bordering Bangladesh. So far, this has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered.But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Many top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and finally deport them where they came from. Who stands to lose?

The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. It essentially means, if a nationwide NRC is implemented as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?

As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRC

Amit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of India

The Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens. A pilot NPR project was launched when the UPA government was in power but was not completed.

NEW DELHI: Amid the protests across the country over the amended Citizenship Act, the government has said that there is no link between the new law and NRC. Home minister Amit Shah had earlier set a 2024 deadline for implementing the NRC across the country.Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday clarified that the exercise to prepare an all-India National Register for Citizens — National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003 — was yet to be notified and as and when it is done, rules and instructions would be framed in such a way that no Indian citizen is inconvenienced.Here is all you need to know about the NRC:"

What is RTI Act: RTI Amendment Bill: Explained,,"NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, after division that allows the Central government to notify the term of office for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) with the Opposition slamming the measure as diluting the provisions of the legislation.

The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with 218 members voting in its favour and 79 against it after a reply by Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh.

The 2005 Act was enacted during the first Congress-led government UPA government. According to the activists, the efficacy of the RTI Act , allowing any Indian to seek information from any authority on the payment of Rs 10, hinges closely on the independence of the CIC and its equivalents in the states — state information commissions that adjudicate the matter in case information is not furnished to applicants within the parameters of the law. Here is explain:

What’s changed in Parliament: While Lok Sabha was never a problem, the NDA’s weakling status in the Rajya Sabha prevented it from pushing several contentious bills — with its total strength in the Upper House less than that of the Opposition. However, that may not be a problem any longer as the NDA, along with some ‘friendly’ parties such as the TRS, YSRCP, BJD and others has a strength of 127 in the 245 member House of Elders, more than the halfway mark of 123. That should help it push through the bill after it passes in the Lok Sabha.

What’s in the bill: The amended bill does away with the fixed tenure of five years for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and the Information Commissioners (IC) — instead, they will serve for a tenure determined by the Central government. Moreover, the salary of the CIC and the ICs which are currently benchmarked with the salary of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the Election Commissioners respectively, which in turn are benchmarked with the salary of a Supreme Court judge, amount to Rs 2.50 lakh, along with a monthly allowance of Rs 34,000 per month — plus the usual perks like rent free furnished accommodation and 200 litres of fuel every month. The amended bill gives the government to fix the salary, which could be lower — given that the Information Commission is a statutory body unlike the EC which is a constitutional body. However, the current incumbents’ salaries will not be affected by the amendment.

How will that affect RTI? Currently, the CIC and the IC are chosen by a three member panel of the PM, the Leader of Opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha and a Cabinet minister nominated by the PM. Similarly, the State Chief Information Commissioners (SCIC) and State Information Commissioners (SIC) are chosen by a three member panel comprising the state CM, the state’s leader of opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in the state assembly and a state cabinet minister nominated the chief minister. The amended bill arrogates the power of appointment and the term as well as the salary of SCIC and SIC to the Central government — which nullifies the independence of the state legislatures. Even the CIC and the ICs will serve at the pleasure of the government — raising the possibility that they would be more interested in ensuring the longevity of their tenures rather than serving the citizens’ interests.

Termination of terms? Current rules stipulate that no CIC, IC, SCIC or SIC serve more than one term, for a maximum period of 5 years or till the age of 65, whichever is earlier. For ICs and SICs, if one of them is nominated to the post of CIC or SCIC, his/her total tenure as both IC and CIC or SIC and SCIC can not exceed 5 years. While the new bill gives the government the power to fix tenures, it's not clear whether an incumbent seen as pliable or ‘friendly’ to the Centre may get to serve more than one term.

Appointments & dismissals: If the tenure of the CIC, IC, SCIC and SIC are to be fixed by the Centre, it may follow that their removal from office may also be dependent on the Centre — whereas in the original bill, the CIC and IC may be removed only by the President — and the state Governor in case of SCIC and SIC — after an enquiry by the Supreme Court finds reason for their dismissal from office.

Donald Trump: US President Trump plans second White House event for Barrett as Senate takes up nomination,,"US President Donald Trump (AP)

WASHINGTON: The White House planned a Monday night celebration of the Republican Senate’s expected confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court , a month after a similar event was linked to a Covid-19 outbreak .

While Democrats have fiercely opposed the conservative jurist’s nomination, Trump ’s fellow Republicans hold a 53-47 Senate majority and her confirmation to a lifetime post on the court seems assured.

Trump pressed the Senate to confirm Barrett before the November 3 election, which would create a 6-3 conservative majority on the top US judicial body. The September 26 Rose Garden ceremony at which Trump officially named Barrett to replace the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg preceded a wave of Covid-19 cases among top Republicans including Trump and first lady Melania Trump . White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters the event planned for Monday evening likely would be held outdoors. “Tonight, we’ll be doing the best we can to encourage as much social distancing as possible,” Meadows said.

Amy Coney Barrett confirmed to US Supreme Court in Trump pre-election triumph,,"Amy Coney Barrett (AP)

WASHINGTON: The US Senate confirmed conservative jurist Amy Coney Barrett as the Supreme Court's newest justice on Monday, delivering a landmark and controversial win for President Donald Trump just eight days before the election.

The deeply divided chamber voted 52 to 48, largely along party lines in the Republican-controlled Senate, making Barrett the third Trump nominee to reach the high court and cementing a six-to-three conservative majority.

Republican lawmakers broke into applause as the tally was read out, and the White House is also expected to celebrate the confirmation in the final run-up to the November 3 election, in which more than 60 million Americans have already voted.

"France Coronavirus: New French cases could be 100,000 per day; Govt adviser",,"PARIS: France may be experiencing 100,000 new Covid-19 cases per day — twice the latest official figure — professor Jean-Francois Delfraissy , who heads the scientific council that advises the government on the pandemic, told RTL radio on Monday. “There is probably more than 50,000 cases per day.We estimate, on the scientific committee, that we are more in the region of 100,000 cases per day,” said Delfraissy. The health ministry reported on Sunday a record 52,010 new confirmed coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours."
Chechen leader says Macron's stance on cartoons inspires terrorists,,"MOSCOW: The leader of Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region said on Tuesday that French President Emmanuel Macron was inspiring terrorists by justifying cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad as protected by free speech rights.

Ramzan Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, made the comments after France warned its citizens living or travelling in several Muslim-majority countries to take extra security precautions because of anger over the cartoons.

The row has its roots in a knife attack outside a French school on Oct. 16 in which a man of Chechen origin beheaded Samuel Paty , a teacher who had shown pupils cartoons of Prophet Mohammad in a lesson on freedom of speech.

The caricatures, first published by a satirical magazine whose Paris offices were attacked by gunmen killing 12 people in 2015, are considered blasphemous by many Muslims.

Kadyrov, an ex-rebel who endorsed a Kremlin military campaign that crushed an Islamist insurgency in Chechnya and nearby Russian regions, has played down the fact that Paty's attacker was born in Chechnya, saying he grew up in France.

In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Kadyrov said Macron was wrong to characterise the display of such cartoons as free speech.

""You are forcing people into terrorism, pushing people towards it, not leaving them any choice, creating the conditions for the growth of extremism in young people's heads. You can boldly call yourself the leader and inspiration of terrorism in your country,"" Kadyrov wrote, addressing Macron.

Macron has hailed Paty as ""a quiet hero"" and has pledged to fight ""Islamist separatism"" in France.

Asked by Reuters to comment, an official in the French presidential administration said: ""We won't be intimidated and we put on notice those who sow hatred, which, in Kadyrov's case, is unacceptable.""

EU warns not enough Covid vaccines for all in Europe until 2022,,"BRUSSELS: Only part of the European Union population can be inoculated against the new coronavirus before 2022, EU officials said in an internal meeting, as the vaccines the bloc is securing may not prove effective or may not be manufactured in sufficient doses.The 27-nation bloc, with a population of 450 million, has booked more than 1 billion doses of potential Covid-19 vaccines from three drugmakers. It is negotiating the advance purchase of another billion vials with other companies.""There will not be sufficient doses of Covid-19 vaccines for the entire population before the end of 2021,"" a European Commission official told diplomats from EU states in a closed-door meeting on Monday, a person who attended it told Reuters A second official confirmed the statement. An EU Commission spokesman was not immediately available for comment.The EU Commission had earlier said vaccines will be limited ""during the initial stages of deployment"" but had never clarified how long the initial phase would last.There is still no effective Covid-19 vaccine, but the first shots could be available at the beginning of next year, the Commission said earlier in October.Given a likely limited supply, the Commission has for months urged EU governments to devise vaccination plans that would prioritise vulnerable and essential groups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly or people with chronic diseases .But apart from a consensus on inoculating doctors and nurses, ""there is no common line on other groups,"" the Commission official said at the internal meeting this week.In July a paper agreed by the Commission and EU governments said at least 40% of the EU population should be vaccinated in the first phase.Some EU countries want to book doses for their entire population with the aim of rolling them out already by mid-2021.A third EU official said this bold goal could be achieved if the EU reached supply deals with at least seven vaccine candidates.The EU has so far secured doses of the potential vaccines being developed by AstraZeneca , Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson. It has also said it is in talks with Moderna, Pfizer and CureVac."
Pakistan summons Indian Chargé d' Affaires over Kashmir issue,,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday summoned the Indian Chargé d' Affaires to protest over the Kashmir issue.

The Foreign Office in a statement said the Indian diplomat was summoned to register "" strong protest "" on the "" Kashmir Black Day "".

It demanded that India rescind its ""unilateral"" action"" of withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcating it into two union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5 last year and bifurcating it into two union territories.

India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.

Prime Minister Imran Khan in his message said that Pakistan will continue to raise his voice in support of Kashmiris.

India has firmly told Pakistan that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir has been, is, and shall continue to be an integral part of India. New Delhi has maintained that issues related to Jammu and Kashmir are internal matters to India.

Arc de Triomphe area in Paris evacuated following bomb alert,,"A view shows the deserted Arc de Triomphe in Paris (Reuters file photo)

PARIS: The area around the Arc de Triomphe in central Paris has been evacuated following a bomb alert , a police spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday.

He said subway lines in the area were also being evacuated.

France is on high alert following the beheading of a teacher earlier this month by an 18-year old Muslim man angry about the use of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a civics lesson.

There have been several false bomb alerts, most recently in the Lyon railway station last week and at the Eifel Tower a month ago.

'We're working on it:' Pope's Covid advisers and the mask,,"ROME: Pope Francis ' decision to forego wearing a mask has been noticed, with some concern, by the commission of Vatican experts he appointed to help chart the Catholic Church's path through the coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath.The Rev. Augusto Zampini, one of the key members of the pope's COVID-19 commission, acknowledged Tuesday that at age 83 and with part of his lung removed after an illness in his youth, Francis would be at high risk for complications if he were to become infected with COVID-19.``He has started to use the mask now,'' Zampini said in response to reporters' questions. ``And I hope he will use it in the general audiences, when he is close to the people. If you're in an open space, we know that it's different. But well, we are working on that.``Francis has courted some criticism for declining to wear a mask when indoors, even though Vatican regulations call for masks indoors and out when social distancing cannot be guaranteed. While Francis' lung condition could help explain his decision to forego the mask, he donned one for more than two hours last week when he presided over an indoor and outdoor interreligious prayer service in downtown Rome.Yet the following day, Francis went maskless during his indoor general audience in the Vatican auditorium, including when he shook hands with a handful of similarly maskless bishops and leaned in to speak privately to each one. On Saturday, he met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who arrived wearing a mask only to take it off for the audience in the pope's library.Photos of the maskless leaders caused a mild stir in Spain over the weekend, but the prime minister's office dismissed it by saying the delegation was following Vatican protocol rules. Spain last week became the first country in Western Europe with more than 1 million confirmed virus cases.The Vatican has declined to respond to questions about Francis and masks.Zampini said the recent rise in infections in the tiny city state have commission members and the Vatican as a whole concerned. Thirteen Swiss Guards and a resident of the hotel where Francis lives have recently tested positive.""We are very worried,"" Zampini said, noting that the Vatican has strong regulations about keeping social distancing and washing hands within the territory. ""We have all protocols in place, but still we have cases.''He acknowledged, though, that the contagion within the Vatican has merely driven home the danger of the virus so that the Vatican itself can be witness to what the rest of the world is experiencing and help be part of the solution.The commission is working to address the current needs of the church around the world with concrete acts of assistance, while also developing policy recommendations for how governments and institutions can re-think global economic, environmental, social, health care and other structures to be more equitable and sustainable."
"Pakistan parliament passes resolution to recall envoy, but has no ambassador in France",,"NEW DELHI: Amid the anti-France protests in response to French President Emmanuel Macron 's remarks about cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad , Pakistan 's Parliament on Monday passed a resolution urging the government to recall its envoy from Paris.

However, Pakistan has no ambassador posted in Paris currently as its previous envoy Moin-ul-Haq left France three months ago when he was transferred and posted as ambassador to China, according to a report in Geo TV.

The report said that since Haq’s transfer, Pakistan has had no envoy in the French capital as the Pakistan foreign office has not designated his replacement so far.

It further added that Muhammad Amjad Aziz Qazi, who is deputy head of mission in the Paris embassy, is currently looking after the affairs of the mission being the senior-most diplomat in Paris.

The National Assembly resolution, which is non-binding, came hours after the French ambassador in Islamabad was summoned to the foreign office for Pakistan to register its protest.

The developments were the latest expression of anger in the Muslim world over France displaying images of the Prophet Mohammad that Muslims consider blasphemous.

The resolution expressed ""serious concern at the highly disturbing statements and hate-mongering, specially by leaders like President Macron, justifying unlawful provocation and insult to the sentiments of more than a billion Muslims"".

The resolution also urged the government to ask other Muslim countries to boycott French products.

Macron had paid tribute to a French history teacher who was beheaded by an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin for showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of speech.

On Sunday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan slammed Macron, saying he had attacked Islam by encouraging the display of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad.

The cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, first published in 2005 by Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, have long been a sensitive topic among Muslims, stirring protests in Pakistan and elsewhere.

Fake news spread on WhatsApp to Indian Americans plays stealth role in US election,,"OAKLAND: New Jersey tech entrepreneur Arun Bantval is US presidential candidate Joe Biden 's top fake-news watchdog on messaging service WhatsApp about the Democrat and his Indian American running mate Kamala Harris.

Messages on WhatsApp, owned by Facebook Inc, are confidential and cannot be seen by moderators who police misleading memes, claims and other content on the social media giant's flagship platform. Two billion users rely on WhatsApp's free app to chat with individuals and groups of up to 256 people.

Bantval, 56, who chairs the Biden campaign's five-member rapid response team focused on South Asian voters, has tracked dozens of concerning messages of unknown origin and crafted about 50 rebuttal graphics and texts over the last three months.

His team and similar ones at nonpartisan groups are trying to fill WhatsApp's moderation void by joining big WhatsApp groups and asking community leaders to report items.

Fighting fake news on social media such as Facebook and Twitter has become standard practice for campaigns. But apps for secret messaging such as WhatsApp have flown under the radar despite serving as a crucial political forum among middle-aged Indians, Latinx and other immigrant groups.

South Asian voters, mostly Indian Americans , will be pivotal in the Nov. 3 contest in swing states such as Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania where results will be close and predict the national outcome, researchers and nonpartisan voting advocacy groups say.

About 72% of Indian-American registered voters plan to back Biden, according to a September survey by Carnegie Endowment. But South Asian Biden supporters and nonpartisan activists worry that misinformation on WhatsApp will affect turnout and support.

""There's just a lot of inaccurate information for an already confusing process,"" said Chavi Khanna Koneru, executive director of nonpartisan group North Carolina Asian Americans Together. ""And this year is different for everybody because we're relying on virtual connections more than ever.""

Each day, users can receive hundreds of memes, videos, voicemails and texts spanning greetings, social invitations and political propaganda. Users regularly forward shocking and humorous messages, with the original sender's name automatically stripped, making it hard to trace them.

""It's almost like going viral on Facebook,"" Bantval said.

WhatsApp said its role in US politics is small. But political misinformation on WhatsApp in Brazil, India and elsewhere prompted the service beginning in 2018 to limit recipients when forwarding messages.

It also introduced a chatbot that users can message to access fact checks by internationally recognized organizations. But when Reuters queried the system for topics in messages sent to South Asian voters, it generated zero results.

WhatsApp also said users can search the web from heavily forwarded messages to find relevant fact checks, though Reuters again found no related results.

A campaign spokeswoman for Republican incumbent Donald Trump said WhatsApp was not a focus for its social media staff. But some misleading messages on the app target him over racial justice policies and alleged extramarital affairs, according to Indian voters from both parties.

""There's more on the Democratic candidates, but there is fake news about the Republican side, too,"" said Kannan Srinivasan, an Orlando businessman.

TAPPING INTO FEARS

It is unclear where WhatsApp misinformation originates or whether the examples observed by Bantval and others are part of organized efforts. They said spelling and wording suggest some authors are Indian residents who view Trump as better for bilateral relations.

Messages seen by Reuters and sent to swing-state voters portray Biden's views on Pakistan, Islam, China, taxation and policing in ways debunked by fact-checking groups.

Bantval said the misrepresentations preyed on older Indian immigrants concerns about crime, wealth and religion.

Other messages sent to South Asian voters in Texas and North Carolina, seen by Reuters, contain false claims that ballots will not count when voters select a Democrat in every contest or when election officials sign dropped off ballots.

Koneru estimated her North Carolina group spends about 15% of its time correcting inaccuracies about voting procedures on WhatsApp and other popular services compared with 2% during the 2016 presidential election.

""We do our best to jump in and clarify but there's so many WhatsApp groups,"" she said.

An American publication, The Cut , landed itself in a soup when they reportedly published an article titled, “Is Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas ’ love for real?”The piece, that was first published on Tuesday, reportedly called Priyanka a “global scam artist” and insinuated that she is using Nick to strengthen her foothold in Hollywood. The piece even went as far as claiming that Nick allegedly “wed against his will.”The article sparked outrage among the actress’ fans, friends and family, who were quick to take to their social media accounts to slam the publication over the piece’s racist and sexist tone.Following the severe backlash, the website reportedly toned down the version of the article by removing certain allegations on Wednesday and chronicled the lead up to their wedding.“While this wedding and its trappings may feel familiar to other extremely public celebrations of celebrity love, well: We all know those marriages turned out,” the piece reportedly read.Images doing the rounds show the show some of the offensive bits that were removed from the article before it was taken down completely.After Nick’s brother Joe Jonas and future sister-in-law, Sophie Turner also stepped up to condemn the piece, the site took down the article and published an Editor’s note on Twitter that said, “Upon further editorial review, we found this story did not meet our standards.

#EtimesSuaveMen: Five ways men can experiment with scarves,,"Whether it is to protect yourself from the cold weather or you need a statement accessory, every man requires a scarf or two in his wardrobe. And, now as the winter season is approaching, it's time to get creative with your scarf draping styles. Be it a casual or business look, learn stylish ways to wear a scarf. Here's a look at five ways you can wear a scarf and beat the chill in style:For a simple and casual look, you can pull off a laid-back style with your scarf. Wrap the scarf around your neck and pull out the ends and adjust at the same level. You can tuck it into your jacket or layer it on top of a fuzzy sweater.If you're not a fan of the 'too casual look', you can drape a scarf over the shoulder. Simply drape the scarf over the neck and keep one end longer than the other. This can help to add a touch of finesse to your casual look.For a formal setting, it is important to drape the scarf with clean lines for a smart look. With a suit, you can try the ascot knot by draping the scarf around the shoulder and form a cross. Then, put one end under the other and pull it up to make a knot and tuck it in for a neat look.(How to tie an ascot knot, Photo: Blacklapel)For a business or official meeting, your scarf needs to look sophisticated and sharp. Ascot and loop knots can work well for a clean look. For the loop knot, fold the scarf in half and wrap it around your neck. Next, add the loose ends through the loop to make this knot.(How to tie a loop knot, Photo: Blacklapel)Whether you're wearing a tuxedo or a suit, a stylish scarf can make a sartorial statement. It's best to stick to fine fabrics like silk and cashmere with subtle patterns. You can wrap the scarf around the neck and tuck it behind the lapels of the jacket as shown in the photo."
Modern retellings that give Ramayana a fresh new perspective,2019-07-10 12:37:24+05:30,"One of the world's oldest epics, Ramayana is not just the base of Hindu religion but also a treatise that set social and societal norms and determined the course of behaviour one should adopt towards one's family and acquaintances. Ram was a perfect brother, son, king and even an ideal husband till destiny turned awry. But was Ram the only ideal character to be emulated? Was Sita's sacrifice the biggest one? Lakshman who left his wife to follow his brother in exile, his wife Urmila who waited patiently for him for 14 years and Bharat who could never rejoice in the crown he got and even Ravana who was an epitome of learning, deserve to be examined from a fresh perspective and not just as less significant characters in the story of Ram and Sita. While there have been numerous retellings of Ramayana in the past, some modern ones done recently are worth being mentioned.

Famous Indian celebrities who have adopted children,2020-10-27 05:00:00+05:30,"Another television couple to adopt children are actors Gurmeet and Debina. Not only are they one of the most loved celebrities, but their decision to embrace parenthood is also heartwarming.

The couple decided to adopt two sisters, Pooja and Lata after learning that they were forced to work as domestic help after their father's demise. Not wanting to deprive the girls of their childhood, the couple went ahead and signed the legal paperwork, taking care of the two as their own family and ever since, they have been living happily ever after.

In fact, the couple also believes that adoption doesn't make any difference in their decision to expand the brood. In an interview, Gurmeet was quoted saying:

“The general belief is that you only adopt if you can’t have children of your own. That’s not true at all. Both Debina and I love kids and plan to have a couple of our own in the future. And when they come along they will be siblings for Pooja and Lata and all the Choudharys will happily live together under one roof.”"

According to sources associated with the production house, the actor will enter the house in the first week of November.A source tells us, “Jasmin is already going strong inside the house and Aly will turn out to be a great ally for her. In fact, both of them will be a strong support system for each other. Aly had openly slammed Nikki Tamboli (Jasmin’s arch rival inside the house) and her team on social media for targeting Jasmin and him in a distasteful manner. What makes the prospect even more interesting is the fact that Jasmin and Aly have always been linked with each other. While they have vehemently denied being a couple, their easy going camaraderie and sizzling chemistry have often set tongues wagging.”Despite repeated attempts, we couldn’t reach Aly for comment. Well, with Diwali approaching, we expect some fireworks both inside as well as outside the house!"

He likes me in the role of Chandramuhi Chautala. He has been very gracious and graceful whenever he has met.

He is very sweet and charming,"" she shared.Commenting on people sometimes calling Salman a biased host, the actress shared, ""He is very moody. The way he shoots the episodes while doing other projects how can one say he was biased. Who knows what footage he has seen. We see an hour long episode, but he watches the 24 hours feed. So, maybe he has seen more than what the audience has seen, so you can't really comment. He is such a charming host and he has his own style. He takes off his jacket while hosting or sometimes even lies down on the stage. He is one of the few people who still has his own style.""Upon her entry in Bigg Boss 14 as one of the wildcards, Kavita was made the captain of the house and she showed her lady boss avatar on the very first day of the show."

French DJ David Guetta is back with Sia to give fans and music lovers a new song of hope - ' Let's Love '.The new single, which was produced and recorded during the COVID-induced lockdown, marked the hit duo's ninth song collaboration. Looking back at the friendship he forged with Sia over the years, Guetta, in an exclusive interview with ETimes, got candid about making music that defines a generation, hopping on-board the K-Pop wagon, reinventing himself and the changing face of the music industry in the times of a global pandemic.From 'Titanium' that defined an era in music with raucous teens screeching the lyrics ""I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose; fire away, fire away"" to getting them to mellow down and change the discourse with 'Let's Love', Guetta said, ""It’s funny you ask because I have been thinking about this a lot.""Explaining how the language of his music changed over the years, he said, ""In 2009, I produced ‘ I Gotta Feeling ’ with The Black Eyed Peas - the year after the Global Financial Crisis. The record became a global #1 hit and I think it was definitely because people wanted to listen to feel-good music. This year I’ve felt inspired by this again. I want to produce music that makes people feel good.""Sharing the inspiration behind 'Let's Love', David said, ""I really wanted to make a happy track because the world was going through some pretty dark times.""His latest track, featuring Sia is an ode to the '80s synthwave culture. Revealing the reason behind incorporating the funky tunes, he said, ""When I think of happy music I immediately think of the ’80s because the sound back then was very cheerful, very upbeat; which is why we chose to take inspiration from that. Working with Sia on this felt very natural, she’s one of the most talented artists I know and when it comes to making such a power anthem no one can compare to her.""Interestingly enough, the DJ says that all it took was a text with some piano chords and his idea of the track for the songstress to work her magic and send the lyrics back ""within 24 hours!""Diversifying his profile and range as an artist, the DJ recently produced BLACKPINK's hit track ' Lovesick Girls '. Speaking on the possibility of a future collaboration with the leading K-Pop bands, he said, ""I would definitely be open to it. The most important thing for me is that I like the song we made and that I am proud of it. If they reach out to me and I like the sound then why not!""With the pandemic bringing industries around the world to a grinding halt, several artists have shared their concerns over the change in the global music scene. Sharing his take on the current grim situation, Guetta said, ""The pandemic has definitely had a huge impact on the global music scene and my thoughts really go out to all the people that work within the industry. I’m very lucky because I don’t have to think about what I’m going to eat the next day but it’s been very tough on a lot of people in the industry.""Looking at the brighter side of this lockdown, he explains, ""For me, it has actually been a very productive period and I’ve also really enjoyed the downtime. I’m used to constantly touring and travelling all over the world so it felt really good to be able to wake up in the same bed every morning. I’ve also been able to spend a lot of time with my kids. This summer is actually the first summer I got to spend with them. We went on holiday in France and I’m really grateful for the time I got to spend with them.""Using his time to the fullest, Guetta has also been working on some new tunes and constantly trying to reinvent himself and his music. We asked him to share a little about his impressive 'WAP' Bootleg, and he happily obliged. ""I had a lot of fun creating that Bootleg. I’ve actually been very productive during the lockdown, it’s been a great period for me to focus on my creativity so I’ve made a lot of music,"" he said.""My friend MORTEN and I started this new sound called ‘Futur Rave’ and we were hesitant to release it at first because it is a sound that was made for festivals - which we, unfortunately, cannot do right now - but, we released it anyway because we felt the fans deserved it. We’ve had an amazing response to it so there’s definitely more stuff coming,"" he added.YouTube demos and tutorials will have to do for a while before we see the star behind the consoles giving EDM lovers some new tunes to jam to. Still, Guetta promises, ""I really hope I can be back soon to play for all my Indian fans. I want to thank them all fans for the support. They always make my visits very special and I cannot wait to party with them again.""In the spirit of his latest track, he signs off saying, ""Love you guys!"""

Britney Spears’ song gets a Hinglish twist; turns into an anti-fake anthem,,"The pandemic has seen an unprecedented rise in the spread of fake news. In fact, sharing of coronavirus-related fake news and rumour on social media platforms and WhatsApp, has become a major concern amid the pandemic. To encourage social media users to act responsibly, to nudge them to ‘pause before you share’ and verify any piece of information before they forward it, Yuvaa , along with various artistes has created a song titled - ‘Oops! I Shared It Again’ - an anti-fake anthem. The parody song of Britney Spears Oops! I Did it Again ,’ is a quirky track, full of humour, punches, intelligently written lyrics, and peppered with upbeat music.Speaking about the song, Nikhil Taneja , co-founder and CEO Yuvaa, a youth media organisation, says, “The track is a part of UN’s initiative, ‘Share Verified’ which aimed at curbing the menace of fake news. When we were asked if we would help spread the message and be a part of the cause, we were delighted as Yuvaa has also been working in the same direction. However, the idea was to make it fun and interesting and not to be preachy at all. Nobody wants to listen to people giving gyaan. It had to be catchy with witty lyrics and fun visuals. While one will enjoy watching the video and listening to the song, the intention is to remind them one has to be careful about sharing news on WhatsApp, and other platforms.”The virtually shot music video features celebrities like Nakuul Mehta, Akash Banerjee, Maanvi Gagroo, Shreya Dhanwanthary Gurmehar Kaur , Yahya Bootwala, Meghnad, and mothers. Sung by Siddhant Bhosale and Saba Azab, the ‘Hinglish,’ track has received a lot of love on social media for reminding people to stop forwarding fake news in a cool, fun way, while taking them on a trip down memory lane.According to a report on UN’s official website, “Unreliable and false information is spreading around the world to such an extent, that some commentators are now referring to the new avalanche of misinformation that’s accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic as a ‘disinfodemic.”Nikhil quips that people being indefinitely confined to their homes, lack of human interactions and connections, increased screen time, consumption of news, etc have resulted in a decline in attention span, thus tempting people to ‘share what they receive’ almost instantly. He adds, “People have a lot of time in hand and they’re spending much more time with their screens now. Every second, there’s a new notification on their mobiles which gives them a dopamine hit. We, as humans, love to share any piece of news or information that resonates with our biases without thinking, this way, we let the biases get the better of us. Oftentimes, we don’t even open the link or read the news, before forwarding to someone else, let alone verifying or checking its authenticity. We live in times when a piece of misinformation/fake news can lead to disastrous consequences while also impacting our mental health. Many of us feel that if we are the first one to forward a new piece people will think, isko sab kuch pata hai. It is important to dissociate ourselves from the constant flow of information, and take the onus and think responsibly. It is time to fight-back and be self-aware. We have to catch ourselves before we fall into the rabbit hole of negativity.”Actor, director, and musician, Saba Azad , who has belted out the number, says that she jumped at the idea of creating the song and being a part of the video. “The song was done pretty much in two days and it was a lot of fun making it. Initially, the idea was to just have my voice, but I thought Siddhant, who was composing the song, has an amazing voice, too. So, we both ended up singing the track. Besides sending such an important message to the world, Britney Spears’ song was the cherry on the cake,” says Saba.Emphasising on the need to talk about curbing fake news in the present time, Saba, says, “The times that we are living in, where there’s a pandemic, communal tension and constant inflow of negative news on news channels and on our screens, we need to be extremely mindful. I wish there were certain rules to regulate and curb misinformation and rumour on TV, social media, and chat groups. Unfortunately, there is no system to do that which is why the onus is upon us to verify the information and be cautious.”Model-actress Shreya Dhanwanthary, who was seen in ‘Why Cheat India,’ who is also a part of the video, says the song couldn’t have been more relevant than now. She says, “I urge everyone to believe or forward anything blindly. Ek basic google search toh karna hi chahiye. Like many, I, too, received messages like ‘dolphins were spotted at the Juhu Beach during the lockdown,’ which obviously wasn’t true! People are extremely impatient and don’t wait for a second before they share a half-baked piece of information with others. They never check it on reliable portals and authorised organisations because they are in a hurry to share it with others. It is important to be comfortable with not knowing everything, instead of learning something that is false and not authentic. Misinformation or half-truth is dangerous and is like a game of Chinese whisper.” The actress says that she has urged friends and relatives not to believe news that they receive and forward/share links and posts on WhatsApp and social media platforms, without verifying them."

Shaan: Singers are at the beck and call of music companies and they crave creative freedom,,"In the last few months a lot of singers have been connecting directly with their fans, performing for fans online, come up with their own music labels, online channels, and have found a way of publishing their own music independently.Singer Shaan , however, did not wait for the lockdown to do so, and began this process over two years ago. He believes that every singer craves freedom to showcase their creativity, so publishing their own music is the best way to accomplish that.“It is very interesting that singers have come up with their own music labels. As singers we are always at the beck and call of music companies , the music directors and the producers. The singer is the last cog in the wheel when it comes to a song. When a song is created the lyrics are first, then the composition and then of course the music, the production, the situation and then finally it is about kisko gawaye? Accha chalo isko gawate hain. So, it is interesting that you can now create your own music,” he shares.Shaan feels passionately about this and reiterates that singers are also musicians and are creative people.Shaan reiterates that singers are also musicians who are creative people. “So, when we have a song in our minds and kuch alag humein karna hai, toh woh kaise karein? Toh yahi ek upay hai, ki apna hi ek music label ho, apna ek music publishing house bana lo, wahan koi aapko rokega nahin, tokega nahin. You can do whatever you want, the way you want it. That is the freedom every singer craves for after a while,” he adds.“We are always at the end of the line. We get everything ready-made, and we just have to sing and present it in front of people. So, your creativity and contribution are limited to just as a singer. But as a creative person, you might want to explore your voice more, your music better,” he says, adding, “I started my own label because I wanted to explore myself as a composer. Through this, I have released over a dozen songs already. My new song ‘China’ is a Bengali one.”"

Kunal Kapoor: In 42 years our theatre has never been dark,,"Stage plays and live theatre have been affected deeply in the last seven months of the global coronavirus pandemic Artistes who depend on live performances have had a lot of trouble with their income being reduced to nothing due to the situation across the world. The over four decade old Prithvi Theatre in Mumbai has been dark too. Talking about it, Kunal Kapoor tells Bombay Times, “The last six-seven months have been terrible; just as has been to most of the world! This November it will be Prithvi Theatre’s 42nd birthday, and in 42 years the Theatre has never been dark. Till this year. No performance on the stage was an inconceivable thought- until the reality of this year.”When asked what has been the silver lining of this pandemic, Kunal quizzes back, “Silver lining? Is that possible?” He adds, “I guess the really silver lining is that all of our loyal and super staff are well and have kept the theatre and themselves in good shape during this nightmare.”In these unprecedented times everyone is evolving and adapting to the new normal.

He was not just a theatre guru , not just a teacher who taught me to act or taught me how to see theatre or how to study it, but he actually gave me insights into what is called looking into the fine moments of life around you. I am from the last batch of students of the legendary Ebrahim Alkazi , but very few people know that I have also spent a decade with him after that. Each play with him was like an investigation into life itself.My first play with him was my first learning into becoming a woman. What do I mean by that? I was a girl who used to wear jeans, short jackets, and leather boots and for the play's costume, I was given a big, fat, fluffy Victorian gown. At first, I could not even carry myself and I would fall everywhere. It was only after a couple of days that I understood why he did that to me. It was because he realised that I was a bit tomboyish and that feminine side of mine, probably that side of being a young girl, got into a bit of obscurity. It had taken a backseat. Next couple of months, almost nine months of rehearsing that play was a peek into life and relationships. But when I look back at my training years with him, every play I did with him was a masterclass of life itself.The Greek tragedy, 'Electra', that I did with him was again a great exercise in human psychology. He would go deep into the history and the background of the time and also into the whole psychology part of it which led to the term - Electra Complex. I was Electra, and that was a deep investigation into the human mind.After finishing work at the Living Theatre Academy in Delhi, the next decade was my personal experience with him through art and painting at Art Heritage , his foundation. Through all the mechanisms of what goes into creating art, he actually taught me how to look at the beauty of life. He used to say that when you start believing in yourself, thinking that you are successful, it is the beginning of the end. He used to always say, ""A teacher will always remain a student. I always learn as much as you learn from me. With each passing generation how the times have changed with the beauty and art around us. How storytelling has changed.""I am inundated with emotions right now, with memories, with the craft that he left with me as a student. Ebrahim Alkazi was also a living legend of our times. The National School of Drama (NSD) would not have happened if he had not been there (Ebrahim Alkazi served as the director of the NSD from 1962 to 1977). The one great gift he left me with, apart from being an actor, was the attention to detail and the interest that I have in theatre academics.Years ago, when I told him about my theatre work in Bhopal, he smiled beautifully, and said to me, ""I am proud of the fact that one of my students at least understood what theatre academics is."" He always believed in creating and nurturing institutions because he always said that the legacy of a teacher is passed from one generation to another, and that’s exactly what he did at the NSD for more than two decades. I cannot thank him enough, and I will always remember him as a great guru, a great artist, a great storyteller, and above all, more than a father to me.A tearful goodbye.

Newspapers are safe: Bhartendu Natya Akademi creates exclusive play for Lucknow Times,,"After organising a 30-day Rang Samaroh and a virtual theatre festival, Bhartendu Natya Akademi (BNA) is doing something really different in the coming week. The faculty and students of the institute have made a play titled Akhbaar exclusively for Lucknow Times on how newspapers are safe to read. The play will be streamed on the Akademi’s Facebook page on August 7 at 9pm. The one-act play conveys the message of how one needn’t be afraid of contracting the Coronavirus by reading the newspaper in the current times and that it is perfectly safe to read the newspaper. The play also features a video of the Times of India (TOI) press which shows the whole procedure of how a newspaper is printed and sanitized before being delivered to the reader.Privendra Singh (BCCL)The play, featuring Manoj Sharma , is directed by Subhadip Raha , and is of 16-minutes duration. The play has been enacted and shot at the Thrust auditorium of BNA. Inspired by Rajesh Kumar’s Niravasan and improvised by Privendra Singh, the play is also supported by Rangpaakhi. “The story revolves around an aged person who is quarantined in his room and suddenly one day stops receiving his newspaper due to the Coronavirus pandemic. So he calls his son to inquire how to get the newspaper and is told by him that it is not safe to get the one as it may be infected with the virus. Then the father sends him a video of the TOI press which shows how the paper is sanitised and how the vendors are checked for their heath and given sanitizers to use before every delivery. He explains that it is perfectly safe to get the newspaper. Hearing this, the son restores his father’s subscription of TOI which makes him very happy,” shares Privendra.Telling us why he chose such a subject, director Subhadip says, “Well, this is my real life story. A similar situation arose at my place during the initial days of the lockdown when I had stopped receiving the newspaper. However, it was a delight to start reading it again once the delivery was restored by the vendor upon my insistence.”"
Rhea Chakraborty requests Bombay HC to dismiss plea of Sushant Singh Rajput's sisters for quashing FIR filed against them,,"Actress Rhea Chakraborty has now requested the Bombay High Court to dismiss a petition filed by late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's two sisters to quash the FIR lodged against them for forging and procuring fake medical prescription for their brother. The actress, who is the complainant in the case against Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, filed an affidavit in the HC recently opposing their plea and said the allegations against them are serious.

It was also mentioned in the same that it needs to be investigated whether Rajput consumed the medicines prescribed, which may have contributed to his death and/or further deteriorated his mental health."

"India, US can jointly deter China’s tyranny: Mike Pompeo",,"NEW DELHI: India and the US are “force multipliers” together and could provide “joint deterrence” against China’s aggression as both countries share a democratic vision in the face of the Chinese Communist Party's tyranny, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said here on Tuesday.In an exclusive interview to Times Now, Pompeo said, “What's become very clear now is there is a battle and the battle in the world is between freedom and authoritarianism and India, like the Unites States, has chosen democracy and freedom and sovereignty and all the things that people of India care so deeply about, so when confronted by tranny by the Chinese Communist Party, you can be sure that the United States will stand by as partners. We will.”“We can be force multipliers and deliver really good outcomes not only for the people of India or the Indo-Pacific but for the entire world,"" Pompeo said, indicating US support at a time when India is facing a major security threat by way of Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh.Pompeo minced no words when describing the Chinese government’s aggressive nature. “When it comes to the Chinese Communist Party, the entire world is the frontline. The ambition, national rejuvenation, the goal of general secretary Xi is not local, it is not regional, that desire is global. You see it in the Belt and Road Initiative that extends throughout Africa and through the Middle East . This is a global challenge and the freedom-loving world must take it on together,” he said.While advising India to stand firm, Pompeo said they had “encouraged the Chinese to de-escalate”. “We think that's in China's best interest, we think it's in India's best interest and the world's best interest. That's our mission set. We don't want a conflict there,” he added."
"Now, anyone can buy land in Kashmir, government notifies order",,"Any person from outside Jammu and Kashmir can now buy land in the Union Territory

SRINAGAR/ NEW DELHI: Any person from outside Jammu and Kashmir can now buy land in the Union Territory, which till now was exclusively meant for permanent residents and residents with domicile certificate with the home ministry making several changes in the land laws.

Though the new laws were in the offing, they reflect the changed political and administrative landscape after Article 370 became a dead letter in J&K. A senior minister said the process was intended to make laws applicable to the rest of India to become the legal tender in the UT as well. He said protections that certain states offered in terms of restrictions on land sale could be considered by the administration, which in the current scenario is the Lt Governor, at a later date.

New MHA rule nullifies 11 land laws of former J&K state

The new MHA rule, called the UT of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of Central Laws) Third Order, 2020, nullifies 11 previous land laws of the former J&K state. The phrase — ‘permanent resident of the state’ — in the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with disposal of land in the UT has been omitted from Section 17 of the law, allowing non-residents to buy land in the UT.

J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha told reporters that the amendments do not allow transfer of agricultural land to non-agriculturists. However, some exemptions in the Act enable transfer of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. The opposition, including regional as well as national parties, expressed reservations against the new law and called it “robbery of land in the name of integration, development and security”.

Bihar assembly elections: Showdown after lockdown,,"RJD can’t rely on M-Y formula

NEW DELHI: The Bihar assembly elections kick off on Wednesday in a part of the state in which RJD had done particularly well five years ago and hence has a lot at stake. Of the three phases this time, it is this first one in which the party then led by Lalu Prasad was most clearly the front-runner, winning 27 seats, almost as many as BJP’s 13 and JD(U)’s 18 put together.Equations have changed significantly since then, with JD(U) now aligned with BJP, RJD for the first time having the entire Left on its side, and the Rashtriya Lok Samta Party of Upendra Kushwaha now out of the NDA. Chirag Paswan’s LJP, too, is no longer part of NDA though the party has been at pains to suggest that its quarrel is only with JD(U), not BJP.While the return of JD(U) to the NDA fold will have an impact across the state, the shifts of smaller players like the Left, in particular CPI(ML) Liberation, and RLSP should matter more in this phase than anywhere else. RLSP had a 5.2% vote share in the 71 seats covered by this phase in 2015, twice as high as its statewide share. The Left, too, registered a higher vote share here (4.2%) than in the state as a whole (3.5%).RJD will hope that the consolidation of Left votes in its favour and the subtraction of RLSP’s votes from the NDA kitty will combine with anti-incumbency agai- nst 15 years of Nitish Kumar’s government to offset the shift of JD(U) back to the BJP-led alliance. Given the relatively low presence of Muslims in this area RJD can’t bank solely on its traditional M-Y formula, which is why what other allies can or cannot bring to the table could prove decisive.Congress, too, has much to lose, having picked up one-third of its 27 seats in 2015 from here. For Left, this could present an opportunity to win more seats than it has in the last two decades.On the other side of the divide, BJP in particular will look at this phase as a chance to significantly improve its 2015 tally and JD(U) will hope it can at least hold on to what it had won last time if not improve."
"Mike Pompeo attacks China, Rajnath Singh says ‘challenged by reckless aggression’",,"Defence minister Rajnath Singh, external affairs minister, S Jaishankar with the US secretary of defence Mark ... Read More

NEW DELHI: India and the US sealed a growing relationship by inking the last foundational agreement to exchange geospatial intelligence which brings defence systems closer and strengthens a compact that now spans a wide spectrum from health, science and technology and education and is undergird by a shared alarm over China’s increasing military and economic aggression.

US secretary of state Mike Pompeo did not hesitate to name China and said, “US leaders and citizens see with increasing clarity that the Chinese Communist Party is no friend to democracy, the rule of law and transparency.” Defence minister Rajnath Singh too did not mince words when he said India was being “challenged by reckless aggression on our northern borders”.

At the third ‘2+2’ meeting between foreign and defence ministers, India and the US signed five agreements, but more importantly signalled the two countries are cutting across a swathe of sectors to work together despite the occasional remarks of US President Donald Trump on trade and more recently on the quality of India’s air. The signing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for GeoSpatial Cooperation (BECA), along with the previous GSOMIA, LEMOA and COMCASA, makes India a close strategic partner of the US even in the absence of a formal alliance. Pompeo and US defence secretary Mark Esper also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi who said, “Our comprehensive global strategic partnership stands on a firm foundation of shared principles and common strategic interests.”

In his initial remarks, foreign minister S Jaishankar, in an oblique reference to China, said, “The ability of India and the US to work closely in defence and foreign policy has a larger resonance . Together, we can make a real difference when it comes to regional and global challenges, whether it is in respecting territorial integrity, promoting maritime awareness, countering terrorism or ensuring prosperity.”

A joint statement welcomed the “growing understanding on the Indo-Pacific among like-minded countries”. It reaffirmed that closer India-US cooperation would “support shared interests in promoting security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond”.

In his opening remarks, Pompeo said India and the US were “cooperating on defeating the pandemic that originated in Wuhan, to confronting the Chinese Communist Party’s threats to security and freedom, to promoting peace and stability throughout the region”.

The joint statement also reaffirmed convergences in the fight against terrorism. “The ministers called on Pakistan to take immediate, sustained and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks, and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators and planners of all such attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai, Uri and Pathankot .” The statement mentioned that visas, a point of contention, would be discussed as part of the consular dialogue.

Countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative, India and the US will undertake joint projects in the Indo-Pacific region. “Recognising the need to contain the build-up of sovereign debt in developing and low-income countries by ensuring responsible, transparent and sustainable financing practices,” the joint statement said.

"sensex today: Sensex drops over 100 points; Nifty below 11,750",,"(File photo)

MUMBAI: Equity benchmark sensex dropped over 100 points in early trade on Tuesday, tracking losses in index majors Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and Infosys amid negative cues from global markets.

After opening with mild gains, the 30-share BSE index made a U-turn and fell 123.22 points or 0.31 per cent to 40,022.28. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty slipped 29.65 points or 0.25 per cent to 11,738.10.

IndusInd Bank was the top laggard in the sensex pack, shedding around 3 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank, ONGC, SBI, HDFC, Infosys and Reliance Industries.

On the other hand, Kotak Bank rallied around 6 per cent, followed by NTPC, Nestle India, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra and M&M.

In the previous session, sensex settled 540 points or 1.33 per cent lower at 40,145.50, while Nifty tumbled 162.60 points or 1.36 per cent to 11,767.75.

Exchange data showed that foreign institutional investors sold equities worth Rs 119.42 crore on a net basis on Monday.

According to Arjun Yash Mahajan, head Institutional Business at Reliance Securities, Indian markets are expected to remain volatile ahead of presidential election in the USA and derivatives expiry week.

While initial trade set up in India looks to be better than other Asian markets, weak global cues may result in selling pressure towards the later part of the day, he said.

US equities witnessed steep correction mainly on emerging concerns about possible slowdown in economic activities led by resurgence of coronavirus infections and fading signs of fiscal stimulus before presidential election, he said.

Additionally, restrictions imposed on economic activities in European countries like Spain and Italy also dampened sentiments.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo were trading on a negative note in mid-session deals, while Seoul was in the positive territory.

Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.54 per cent higher at $41.03 per barrel.

"Reliance Future Deal: Future, Amazon may battle stay on RIL deal in Delhi HC",,"BENGALURU: Echoing Reliance Industries, Future Group on Monday said the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) order granting an interim stay on the merger is “not enforceable” in India and needs to be tried in an “appropriate forum under the provisions of Indian Arbitration Act”.Kishore Biyani’s Future Retail (FRL) said that it is not a party to the agreement under which Amazon has invoked arbitration proceedings, as the battle for India’s retail market between Mukesh Ambani and Jeff Bezos heats up.According to sources close to Amazon, Future’s statement is being seen as “antagonistic” by Amazon India, and counter to the contractually agreed-upon method to resolve the dispute.“There are enough provisions for the international arbitration ruling to be enforced in India without approaching the Indian courts. International arbitration was part of the deal between the two companies,” this person added, who is aware of Amazon’s thinking on the matter.However, multiple sources added the latest situation is an indication of Future Group’s plans of approaching Indian courts to challenge the matter. These sources said, at this point, both the parties could end up at Indian courts to enforce or challenge the interim ruling. “The jurisdiction will be Delhi high court, if the matter reaches there. This is definitely an option on the table (for Future),” one of the people mentioned earlier added.A Future Group spokesperson declined to comment beyond its media statement on Monday. “In any enforcement proceedings, FRL would take appropriate steps to ensure that the proposed transaction will proceed unhindered without any delay,” it said.Reliance, which said in August it is buying Future Group assets for Rs 24,713 crore, had issued a similar comment on Sunday, indicating it wants to go ahead with the formal process of closing the deal, currently pending with regulators like the Competition Commission of India (CCI). As of Monday evening, regulators were yet to be informed officially about the SIAC order on the Reliance-Future deal. The SIAC interim order is valid for 90 days. A final order is expected to come before this deadline expires.“As per the advice received by FRL, all relevant agreements are governed by Indian law and provisions of Indian Arbitration Act for all intents and purposes and this matter raises several fundamental jurisdictional issues which go to the root of the matter. Accordingly, this order will have to be tested under the provisions of Indian Arbitration Act in an appropriate forum,” the company added.Earlier in October, Amazon had approached SIAC over its dispute with Future Coupons, one of the holding companies of Biyani’s Future Group where Amazon had invested Rs 1,431 crore, citing breach of terms due to its sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries. This was preceded with a legal notice from Amazon to Future Group citing breach of terms by the latter."
Anil Ambani: Yes Bank plans to take over Anil Ambani’s HQ,,"Anil Ambani (File photo)

MUMBAI: Yes Bank has started the process for obtaining physical possession of Reliance Centre , the headquarters of Anil Ambani ’s Reliance Group in Mumbai. The bank is seeking to either sell the property to realise its dues, or may move its headquarters there.

In July, the private lender had taken symbolic possession of the sprawling complex situated off the Western Express Highway and overlooking the Mumbai airport. The action was taken under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest ( SARFAESI ) Act to recover dues of Rs 2,892 crore from Reliance Infrastructure . In terms of the act, the bank has to give a two-month notice before taking possession, which the bank had done in May.

Speaking to TOI, Yes Bank MD & CEO Prashant Kumar said, “This is a security for our loan. We had already taken symbolic possession, now we are moving to take physical possession. We would like to monetise it, but we may also move our offices there.”

A Reliance Infrastructure spokesperson said, “The matter is sub judice, and as legally advised, the company will take all effective steps to protect its interest.” Sources close to the group said that it is premature for Yes Bank to make plans for the property as the legal process could go on for some time.

Even during the peak of the pandemic, the premises on the 21,432-sqmtr plot was valued at Rs 1,000-1,100 crore. Currently, the commercial real estate market is subdued as there is uncertainty over demand for office space in the aftermath of the pandemic as many believe that work-from-home may become a norm.

However, there are private equity investors who are bullish on real estate. In June, Canadian investment firm Brookfield acquired two floors of office space earlier owned by Jet Airways for Rs 490 crore. The Jet Airways headquarters is located in the business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, which is 5km from the Reliance Centre.

Yes Bank currently operates out of the Indiabulls Finance Centre in Lower Parel where it leased the top six floors. According to news reports in 2011, the deal was struck at Rs 125 per sqft per month for 1.6 lakh sqft. However, since the reconstruction of the bank after its revival by investors led by SBI, the lender has been cutting costs. It has asked all offices to renegotiate rentals and has been rationalising branches and ATMs.

Reliance Group had shifted to the new headquarters in 2018. After its debt crisis, the group has shrunk its operations. Most of the offices were consolidated in the north wing and part of the property was listed for lease. The lockdown due to the pandemic resulted in further consolidation of office space as staff were asked to work from home.

Loan moratorium cashback: November 5 cutoff for banks to credit compound interest collected,,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday informed the Supreme Court that by November 5 lending institutions must credit into the accounts of borrowers who had availed loans up to Rs 2 crore the compound interest collected during the six-month loan repayment moratorium period and then claim reimbursement from the Union government .“The central government has directed that all lending institutions shall give effect to the scheme and credit the (compound interest) amount calculated as per the scheme in the respective accounts of borrowers by November 5,” the finance ministry said in an affidavit.The SC had asked the government to explain the mechanism to implement its decision to waive interest on interest for the six-month moratorium period for those who had borrowed up to Rs 2 crore, including MSMEs . The Centre had said the benefit would be available to those who had availed the moratorium, paid their instalments or had partially availed the benefits.The ministry said, “Under the scheme, all lending institutions shall credit the difference between compound interest and simple interest in the respective accounts of eligible borrowers for the period between March 1 and August 31. The amount shall be credited by each of the lending institutions under the scheme irrespective of whether such eligible borrowers have fully availed, or partially availed or have not availed of the moratorium, which is deferment in payment of instalments.“After crediting the said amount in the respective accounts of eligible borrowers, the lending institutions would claim reimbursement from the central government through the nodal agency of State Bank of India as stipulated under the scheme,” it added.The ministry said this decision was taken after “careful consideration, keeping in mind the overall economic scenario, the nature of borrowers, impact on the economy and such other factors as a policy decision earmarking the stipulated class of borrowers for grant of benefits.”"

"Loans against FDs, bonds, shares out of relief plan",,"TNN

Mumbai: Loans against fixed deposits , bonds and shares will not be eligible for relief under the government scheme for an ‘ex gratia’ payment to borrowers of up to Rs 2 crore. However, in the case of credit card dues , the government has clarified that the outstanding as on February 29 will be eligible for relief.

The government on Tuesday released FAQs ( frequently asked questions ) on its scheme to provide ex gratia payment for the difference between simple and compound interest for borrowers of up to Rs 2 crore. This is available for the period of moratorium (March 1 to August 31, 2020) announced by the RBI . The FAQs clarify that for calculating the Rs 2-crore loan amount limit, banks will take into account all borrowings and not just a single loan.

While the moratorium relief was available for only those borrowers who did not have any overdue payments, the government’s ex gratia payment is available to even special mention accounts — or those that have overdues for less than 90 days, but are not non-performing assets. For payment to credit card holders, the relief will be calculated using the interest rate charged by the bank for converting outstandings into EMIs and not the rate charged to those who revolve their balances. According to bankers , loans against securities are not eligible as these are used by traders to take leveraged positions in the market.

The relief will be available on MSME loans , and loans for education, housing, consumer durables and automobiles. Other consumption loans — including personal loans , credit card dues and loans to professionals — are also covered.

The FAQs state that lenders will assess the total loan outstanding of a borrower based on information available with them as well as the information that is accessible from credit information bureaus. What this means is that if a borrower has a home loan of Rs 1.5 crore, an education loan of Rs 50 lakh and an auto loan of Rs 10 lakh, his total borrowing will be reckoned to be over Rs 2 crore from the banking system.

In respect of education loans, housing loans, automobile loans, personal loans to professionals and consumer loans, the rate of interest to be applied for calculating the differential interest component shall be the contracted rate as specified in loan agreements documentation applicable as on February 29, 2020. In case where no interest is being charged on equated monthly instalments for a specified period, for relief, interest may be applied at MCLR/ base rate as the case may be.

Pandemic to wipe out 3 yrs of states’ fiscal gains: RBI,,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has warned that the Covid-19 pandemic will wipe out three years of fiscal consolidation gains of the states. It also said that the redemption pressure of state debt is likely to double from 2026.

In its annual report on state finances, the RBI called for states to revise their fiscal legislation to chart out a path for getting out of the debt burden. The report said that the pandemic may also leave lasting scars on federalism in India. It will have a bearing on inter-generational transfers, with lower discretionary spending or higher taxation in future.

States’ indebtedness is set to rise, and if it is not accompanied by an acceleration in growth, fiscal sustainability will become the casualty, overwhelming the modest gains of the prudence in recent years, the report said.

According to the RBI, states have been at the forefront in the fight against the pandemic and the public health crisis it has spawned. Besides the “biggest migration in the world”, the debilitating combination of compression in tax receipts and ramped-up expenditures has generated unprecedented pressures on fiscal positions at sub-national levels, the central bank said in its annual report on state finances.

“States have budgeted their consolidated gross fiscal deficit (GFD) at 2.8% of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2020-21. However, the Covid-19 pandemic may alter budget estimates significantly, eroding the gains of consolidation secured in the preceding three years,” the RBI said. A pointer was the deficit target as a percentage of gross states domestic product (GSDP), which was 4.6% for states that announced budgets after a lockdown, while the average GFD for states that presented their budgets before the outbreak of Covid-19 is 2.4% of GSDP .

“Like the centre, states may also consider revising their fiscal legislation by bringing in the desired counter-cyclicality and by incorporating debt as a medium-term anchor,” the RBI said. It said the next few years are going to be challenging for the Indian states. “They need to remain empowered with effective strategies to drive through these difficult times. Sub-national fiscal policy has to be judicious and calibrated. Across states, maintaining overall stability, quality of spending and credibility of budgets may distinguish one state’s resilience from another,” the report said.

TaMo Q2 loss widens to Rs 307 crore,,"TNN

Mumbai: Losses at Tata Motors , the flagship of the Tata Group , widened to Rs 307 crore in Q2FY21 from Rs 188 crore a year ago. Revenue declined 18% to Rs 53,530 crore as the global health crisis sapped demand for new vehicles. The company expects a gradual recovery of demand in the coming months even as there are concerns about a second wave of infection in many countries.

Expenses fell 16% to Rs 54,983 crore as it kept a tight lid on costs. Employee benefit expenses declined 12% to Rs 6,409 crore due to government grants received by its UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). The British unit, which accounted for 78% of Tata Motors’ revenue, received grants of Rs 534 crore (55 million pounds). JLR ’s revenue fell 21% to Rs 41,768 crore while operating profit declined 77% to Rs 577 crore in Q2FY21.

Tata Motors’ automotive debt decreased to Rs 61,000 crore from Rs 68,000 crore in the September quarter of fiscal 2020. The company said it was committed to achieving a near-zero net automotive debt in the coming years by executing cash and cost savings with rigour. “We are squeezing the lemon dry in terms of cost savings,” said the company CFO P B Balaji.

Tatas eye up to 51% in Bigbasket,,"Digbijay Mishra & Madhav Chanchani | TNN

Bengaluru: The Tata Group is exploring the acquisition of a large stake in Bigbasket in a deal which has the potential of being the biggest investment by a local conglomerate in a new-economy business. The salts-to-software conglomerate has discussed taking up to 51% stake in the grocery e-tailer . This will include a fresh capital infusion for business expansion besides the purchase of shares from existing shareholders like Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba , said three sources briefed on the matter.

The development comes at a time when the Indian government has heightened restrictions on Chinese investments amid geopolitical tensions, including the border clash. Alibaba holds 25-30% in Bigbasket, having first invested in the company in 2018. The potential entry of Tatas could give the 10-year-old company a buffer against the backlash on its foreign shareholdings and intensifying competition with the entry of Reliance Industries ’ JioMart , said the sources.

A deal has still not been finalised and the potential shareholding of Tatas will depend on valuations and result of discussions with existing shareholders, cautioned the sources. The discussions with Alibaba will be important as it has various rights, including the right of first refusal ( ROFR ) on a stake sale to competitors, said one of the sources briefed on the matter. TOI could not ascertain if Tatas are listed as competitors.

“Even if Tatas come in, the company will continue to be run by the same management and it will give them a long-term backer with deep pockets,” said the source mentioned earlier. The move is expected to be a part of the Tatas’ super-app play and will open another front in the grocery commerce wars between Reliance JioMart , Amazon India and Walmart-owned Flipkart besides startups like Grofers .

The conglomerate had set up Tata Digital last year for the effort. “There could be a potential tie-up with Trent-owned Star Bazaar as well for pick-up and distribution,” said another source briefed on the matter. Tata Group and Bigbasket spokespersons declined to comment when contacted by TOI, while an emailed query to Alibaba did not elicit a response.

The development comes as Bigbasket has also been in parallel discussions with financial investors like Singapore’s Temasek, US-based Generation Investments and hedge fund Tybourne Capital for its new round of funding, as TOI reported on September 29. Bigbasket is also eyeing an IPO next year, TOI had reported. Bigbasket is expected to get a pre-money valuation of about $1.6 billion and, depending on the final capital infusion in the company, its valuation in the current round can reach close to $2 billion.

Bigbasket’s annualised gross sale run-rate crossed $1 billion for the first time in May, when it recorded Rs 650 crore, or almost $90 million, of sales. The monthly sales number have now reached about Rs 750 crore or about $102 million last month, pegging annualised run rate to over $1.2 billion. The company is also targeting operating profitability soon. Bigbasket’s new round also comes as the company has been consolidating its position in the space, especially the morning milk delivery market where it acquired DailyNinja earlier this year.

MSCI index rejig to bring $2.5bn inflow,,"TNN

Mumbai: The Indian stock market is expected to see an additional foreign fund inflow of about Rs 18,500 crore ($2.5 billion) in December because of a rejig in the MSCI ’s Emerging Market index . This restructuring may boost India’s weight to close to 9% from 8.1% now in the index.

Kotak Bank, L&T, Asian Paints , Bajaj Finance and Britannia are seen to be the biggest beneficiaries of the MSCI rejig . Among the foreign fund managers who invest in India, MSCI’s Emerging Market index is one of the most followed ones. Once the index is rebalanced, all the funds benchmarked to the MSCI index have to rejig their portfolios according to the new weight. After the November rejig of the index, a host of Indian stocks are expected to see their weights increase.

“MSCI will implement changes in foreign ownership limits (FOLs) in the MSCI Global Indexes containing Indian securities coinciding with the November 2020 semi-annual index review at the close of November 30, 2020, effective December 1, 2020. The FOL changes result from the relaxation of the foreign portfolio investor ( FPI ) limit of Indian companies to the sectoral limit,” a report by Morgan Stanley noted. The exact change in the index will be announced on November 11.

According to a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the rejig is expected to lead to an additional inflow of nearly Rs 5,100 crore in Kotak Bank , about Rs 1,200 crore each in Bajaj Finance, L&T and Asian Paints, and about Rs 1,050 crore each in Britannia and Nestle.

ICICI Pru reports flat net profit for Q2,,"Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com

Mumbai: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance reported a net profit of Rs 303 crore for the quarter ended September 2020, almost unchanged from Rs 302 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Although pre-tax earnings were higher by 8%, a higher tax liability during the quarter flattened profit growth.

The company ended the quarter with assets under management of Rs 1,81,492 crore — an increase of 19% over the corresponding quarter last year. New business premium recovered in the second quarter to end flat for the quarter at Rs 2,957 crore, helping offset some of the decline seen in the first quarter brought on by the strict lockdown in response to the pandemic . The new business premium for the first half was Rs 4,456 crore.

Announcing the results, ICICI Prudential Life MD & CEO N S Kannan said that the value of new business (VNB), or new business profit , for the quarter stood at Rs 401 crore with an expansion in VNB margin to 27.4% from 21.1% in the corresponding period last year. He said that the margins had widened due to market-leading sales of protection policies with the share of protection business increasing to 19.5% from 14.8% a year ago.

“The company’s new business premium was better than our forecast of de-growth of 16%. The performance was mainly supported by a sharp jump of 45% in single premium while first-year premium registered a de-growth of 32%,” said Prayesh Jain, lead analyst at Yes Securities.

Kannan said that risk-aversion among customers led to higher sales of long-term savings product, which grew 45% year-on-year for the quarter. “As part of our strategy to deepen and widen distribution, we forged new strategic partnerships with IndusInd Bank and NSDL Payments Bank . To fulfil our vision of securing the protection and long-term savings needs of Indian families, we will continue to expand and be present across platforms and geographies,” he said.

"Ability to reinvent, handle disruptions crucial for leadership",,"Most organisations are now on a path to recovery, even as we still grapple with the dreaded pandemic . Several have transformed many practices, processes and even business models, keeping employee, consumer, customer and community safety in mind. These few months have been quite unprecedented, and everyone was forced to change some habits and ways of life. Covid has taught many things. But at a personal leadership level, subconsciously we have enhanced our ability to handle some epic competencies not faced before, or at such a grand scale. Many, however, are still hurriedly trying to go back to the old normal, assuming it will be soon back to the past. On the other hand, many have transformed significantly. It’s not a right or wrong game — it’s about seizing and sustaining the new habits and reinventing one’s own leadership, given this opportunity has dawned so widely, albeit in the form of an acute crisis. In many areas, the pandemic seems to be having a second or even third wave. Who knows, in future there could be another unprecedented lockdown due to a completely different reason. So, ability to reinvent and carry on the personal transformation agenda will be crucial...Ability to self-develop: With travel and commuting vanishing from our daily routine, we have more time in hand. Is this being used to sharpen the saw, or just incessantly cutting the trees? Many leaders have identified a clear personal development plan and worked on them — be it reading, podcast, audiobook, attending webinars, journaling, taking team sessions or just reflecting on career, business & life. The proliferation of online courses, and that too for free, have prompted many to sign up for multiple ones and complete them. Would you be continuing to develop yourself, or is it back to drowning in monthly, quarterly XL & PowerPoint reviews, and the QSQT syndrome? Learning, training and development in most organisations get chopped at the first sign of challenges. That aside, how much you invest in your own development through time, course, projects, coaching, mentoring will decide your shelf life in the new mega competitive post-Covid world. Development begins at home.Ability to handle disruption : Initially, we were hoping normalcy would resume soon and hence our commitment to change was half-hearted. Slowly, we realised what was needed and made many changes — be it meeting duration, blending work for home with office work, reaching out with a caring message than demanding insane output overnight. We were all forced to change many daily habits, and this has increased our leadership skill to sense the unknown and figure out ‘what will work for me and my team’. What are the personal changes that you are still sustaining? Be it leading, inspiring, communicating, caring, empathising. Are they getting practised still or is it back to the old model of command & control, harsh feedback & yelling, cold turf war, convoluted mail wars and showing “I am right and I know all” than others?Ability to be more diverse/agile: Many leaders have used the Covid opportunity to innovate — be it in business or transforming themselves. WFH has cut out the noise, distraction and multitasking, and brought in a sense of discipline, focus and serenity. Have you been able to think differently? Achieved something new? Were you able to sell your ideas in cross-functional teams? Across the organisation? The pandemic thaw made everyone more receptive to others’ ideas. Have you been able to encash that and experimented with a new idea? Or will you go back to the traditional, age old well-crafted ‘Strategy & mission document and drive usual KPIs ’? How would your mid-year appraisal go? Will a new initiative stand out or will it be last year’s copy-paste & repeat?Ability to enhance leadership effectiveness - fear of death & hence diet: The core in this pandemic is ‘death’, which led to most behaviour changes. This forced us towards home food & supplements like vitamins, healthy stuff and stopping a few habits. As a result, our personal energy and effectiveness have improved. Lasting through 10 or 12 hours of Zoom calls back to back is a great sign. Although some fatigue has set in, most leaders by now are used to these long hours and still practice walk, yoga, Zumba, fitness apps, home-gymming, and have replaced online ordering of delicacies with a fortified diet and discipline. What are the changes you have brought in and are continuing? Or its slowly getting back to pizza, burger & biryani? Mental wellness and leadership effectiveness will depend a lot on sustenance of a healthy diet & fitness regime.Recognising the effort of the last 7 months is almost like congratulating someone on getting into an IPL team. However, metaphorically winning the IPL trophy will depend on — among many other things — the personal leadership transformation commitment and one’s discipline on leading disruption, development, diversity and diet.(The writer is chief people officer, Allied Blenders & Distillers)"

However, small businesses having a turnover of less than Rs 75 lakhs, can enrol under the GST Composition Scheme and pay a flat GST based on their aggregate turnover. You should check whether your supplier is enrolled under GST Composition Scheme or not.Next is to find out the type of transactions, for example - Business to Business; Business to Consumer where the value of supply is more than Rs 2.5 lakhs; or Business to Consumer where the value of supply is less than Rs 2.5 lakhs."

4 Things your personal care products are hiding from you,,"If you think food laws in India should be stricter, you’ll be appalled to know how regulations pass cosmetics off. With little supervision, most brands exploit the carte blanche they enjoy and lace your favourite personal care products with toxicants. While that shampoo might make your hair smooth temporarily, you might completely lose it in the long run; the body wash that smells of irresistible strawberries might be making your skin itchy; the face wash that promises to be mild may slowly be ageing you.Because the beauty industry is highly unregulated and authorities only supervise products for colour additives and ingredients classified as over-the-counter drugs, the onus of making sure we use everything safe comes down to us. After all, it is our skin and wellbeing is at the risk of getting marred by synthetic chemicals that are not only skin irritants, skin penetrators, endocrine disruptors but also carcinogenic.Which is why, it becomes imperative that you read the labels of all personal care products judiciously and make an informed buy. Here’s a list of ingredients you must avoid at all costs:Widely used as preservatives to prevent the growth of bacteria, mold and yeast in personal care products, parabens contain oestrogen-mimicking properties that have been linked with an increased risk of breast cancer. Found in makeup, body washes, deodorants, shampoos and facial cleansers, these toxins are absorbed by your skin and cause deadly diseases. But one cannot stop using these essentials altogether, right? Yes, but one can for sure turn to the alternatives - organic, handmade, paraben-free variants like this All Natural Neem Soap , which is made of everything natural and safe like glycerin,neem extract, neem oil, basil essential oil, basil natural fragrance. It is especially free of parabens.Like we said, read labels. If it mentions things like FD&C or D&C, the product contains artificial colours. In this case, F represents food and D&C represent drugs & cosmetics. Usually, these letters are followed by a colour and number, for example, D&C Red 27 or FD&C blue 1. So far so good, right? Not so fast. These are synthetic colours that may have been derived from petroleum or coal tar sources and have dreadfully been linked to ADHD in children. In fact, they’re banned in many countries of the world. Trust only products such as this Rose Water Facial Toner that boasts of having been made with one ingredient only - 100% pure rose water steam, and is free from phthalates, parabens, sulfates, mineral oil, alcohol, and synthetic dyes.While most of us are fond of fragrances and make many purchases basis how fruity, sweet, amazing the product smells, know that the term was created to mask ‘secret (read: harmful) formula.’ Beware that under the mention of fragrance, the brand could be hiding many hazardous chemicals that can be linked with allergies, dermatitis, respiratory distress and potential effects on the reproductive system. Pay special attention to the ingredient list while picking perfumes, colognes, conditioners, shampoos, body washes and moisturizers.Similarly, a group of chemicals used to increase the flexibility and softness of plastics called phthalates are often hidden under the disguise of ‘fragrance’. One of the most commonly used phthalates are dibutyl phthalate used in nail polish, diethyl phthalate in perfumes and lotions, and dimethyl phthalate in hair sprays. These are all known to be endocrine disruptors and have been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer and reproductive birth defects in males and females.Steer clear of such ‘secret formulae’ by choosing conscious brands that do not keep their ingredients inconspicuous such as this Hair & Scalp Care Shampoo and Himalayan Pink Salt Calamine Handmade Soap But the bad news is that Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) / Sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are found in 90% of commercial personal care products. SLS may even react with other chemicals to create nitrosamines, a carcinogen. Such deadly combinations may lead to severe issues like kidney and respiratory damage. Many of your shampoos, body washes/cleansers, mascaras and acne medications contain them. But not this Red Wine & Silk Cleanser , which is completely free from chemical additives and is only made using natural ingredients.While it is not possible to avoid every single chemical or product laden with toxins completely, we can always be careful and make a conscious effort to buy things full of goodness and purity. Be sure to eat clean, avoid processed foods and products, and shop consciously on Qtrove.com - the platform of goodness that lists local sellers who make sustainable, organic products for the conscious consumer in you.Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of Qtrove.com by Times Internet’s Spotlight team."

For loan prepayment, one needs to be financially disciplined and committed. Furthermore, the applicant need not pay pre-closure charges if the interest rate on home loan is adjustable (floating). But in case of fixed rate, a penalty or fee needs to be paid.: The loan applicant can save money on a lower interest rate. One needs to negotiate on the rate of interest with the bank. Being an old and loyal customer, the bank would definitely regard and provide a lower interest rate.: Before applying for a home loan, one needs to do a lot of research. There might be a possibility that two banks have the same rate of interest but the application fee and other charges may vary. Therefore, thorough research is a must as it would help in saving a lot of money. The loan applicant can also compare the home loans through online marketplaces and choose the best which suits his/her requirements.: Start making investments in different schemes so that a good amount can be collected to make the down payment for the home loan.

Usually, the bank that takes over the home loan, offers a lower rate of interest to the loan applicant. This further helps you with lower interest amount and lesser loan tenure. Obtaining home loan balance transfer is easy and effective for the purpose of saving interest.Always keep in kind that prepaying your home loan to the maximum, making investments and channelizing the income in a better way can be of great help in terms of saving.

ELSS Funds : 5 Things to Keep in Mind Before Investing in ELSS Funds for Tax Saving,,"1) Lock-in period

2) Risk

3) Equity investment experience

4) Section 80C allows only Rs 1.5 lakh of investment

5) Be realistic about returns

How safe is investing in ELSS funds?

ELSS funds are one of safe ways to have exposure in equity market compared to directly investing in Equities. It is advisable to do a SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) in ELSS rather than investing a lumpsum amount as it would factor in the market fluctuations and reduces the risk. Why ELSS is considered as a good investment option?

Equity Linked Savings Scheme, commonly called ELSS is a type of diversified equity mutual fund which is qualified for tax exemption under section 80C of the I-T Act. It offers the twin-advantage of capital appreciation and tax benefits. Hence, ELSS makes a very good investment option for tax saving as well as investment. Is maturity of ELSS taxable or not?

Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) qualify for tax deductions of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of Income Tax Act. Is there a lock-in period for ELSS funds?

Yes, ELSS funds have a lock-in period of three years.

Equity Linked Saving Schemes or also commonly called as ELSS, are the great options for tax saving investment. But if you are considering investing in the ELSS funds then you should know everything about it.Here's we give you five points that you should know about ELSS funds before you invest into one of these funds:It is a fact that ELSS, the tax saving mutual funds, have the shortest mandatory lock-in period as compared to other investment options available under Section 80C of Income Tax Act. For example, an ELSS has a lock-in period of three years, whereas a Public Provident Fund (PPF) account has 15 years of the lock-in period. However, ELSSs should not be considered a short-term investment product. Your investment horizon in ELSSs should be of at least five to seven years. Also, it is not advisable to take out money out of ELSS funds before 3 years. Consider ELSS funds for long term investment plans.What puts off most of the new investors from ELSS is the fact that it invests mostly in stocks and hence carries a higher risk. But you can minimize the risk by having a long-time investment horizon in ELSS. And that's why it is advisable to keep investing in ELSS even after 3 years of the lock-in period. The only way to beat the volatility of the market and to make superior returns from stocks is by staying invested for a long period.ELSS is an ideal way to begin your investment in the equity market. Since ELSS come with a mandatory lock-in period of three years, it gives investors a chance to get used to the volatility of the stock market. It would be a good equity market debut for many investors for their future investment in other equity mutual fund schemes.The Section 80C of the Income Tax Act allows you to claim the tax deduction on investment up to Rs 1.5 lakh only. The Section 80C is an overcrowded section where many investment options qualify for tax deduction, for example, PPF, EPF, FD, NPS, NSC, ULIP etc. So, you need to calculate before finalizing the amount you would be investing in ELSS funds because, if you invest more than the required amount, it won't give you extra deduction under Section 80C.Yes, ELSSs hold strong potential to offer good returns because they invest mostly in equity stocks. However, you have to be realistic about your expectation from the returns. For better returns, you need to be invested for a longer term."

Tax Saving for salaried: Five tax saving tips for salaried individuals,,"NEW DELHI: Tax planning for salaried employees is easy and simple if do it on time and take care of few important points. The planning for income tax saving should start at the beginning of the financial year i.e. April and not in the months of February and March.

The choice of investment tool should be made based on your financial goals, risk profile and income levels.

3) Make the priority list

After you are done with these, the next step is to consider in investing tax-saving mutual funds, ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans), ELSSs equity-linked saving schemes). You can also invest in PPF and NSC if you prefer low risk options.

4) Tax benefit under home loans

If case you have taken a home loan, you can claim tax benefits under Section 80C by furnishing proof of principal re-payment on the home loan. You can also claim tax benefits under Section 24 towards interest payment on the home loan.

How and when to revoke home loan tax deductions,,"Lock-in period

The deduction on home loan

A number of sections under income tax falls under the category where you can claim deductions for investments and expenses incurred during the particular financial year. Deductions like these help in bringing down the taxable income and also reduce your tax liability.For further information, in many cases, a lock-in period is specified against which you may have claimed a deduction. In case you fail to observe the lock-in period, the deductions that you availed can be officially cancelled.Here is the detailed information about the lock-in periods that need to be observed if you have claimed deduction against repayment of home loan principal amount.Though there is no as such lock-in period for deduction claimed against interest payment on home loan as per section 24(b) or 80EE, the section 80C(5) (relating to repayment of principal) of the Income Tax Act specifies that if you sell your house within 5 years from the date of purchase, the deduction claimed on principal repayment during previous years gets revoked. In such a scenario, all deductions claimed for the home loan principal repayment under section 80C during the previous years also have to be clubbed and added to income of the year of sale, and be taxed depending on that only.In addition to the home loan principal amount, the stamp duty and registration fee paid for registration of property also qualifies for deduction under section 80C in the year of purchase. If you had claimed registration fee and stamp duty also as deduction, you need to observe 5-year lock-in in such cases too.In case you take a home loan for buying or building a house, the capital repayment and interest paid on the loan qualify for deduction under separate income tax sections. While the principal repayment falls under the section 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and has a total limit of Rs 1.5 lakh a year, the interest payment on home loan qualifies for deduction under section 24 (b) of the Act, with a total limit of Rs 2 lakh a year. There is an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 for interest payment on home loans under section 80EE for the first-time homebuyers."

Almost 80% of the 4.39 lakh voluntary subscribers joined the scheme only in the past two years. Also, 75% of the 5.85 lakh corporate sector investors joined NPS in the past four years. Clearly, these investors have been attracted by the tax benefits offered on the scheme. Four years ago, it was announced that up to 10% of the basic salary put in the NPS would be tax free. The benefit under Section 80CCD(2d) led to a jump in the corporate NPS registrations. The number of subscribers shot up 83%: from 1.43 lakh in 2012-13 to 2.62 lakh in 2013-14.

What is NPS?

Two years ago, the government announced an additional tax deduction of `50,000 under Sec 80CCD(1b). The number of voluntary contributors shot up 148% from 86,774 to 2.15 lakh. It turned into a deluge after the 2016 Budget made 40% of the NPS corpus tax free, with the number of subscribers in the unorganised sector more than doubling to 4.39 lakh. This indicates that tax savings, define the flow of investments in India. However, many investors are unable to decide which pension fund they should invest in. The problem is further compounded by the fact that the NPS investments are spread across 2-3 fund classes.

How to calculate NPS?

So, we studied the blended returns of four different combinations of the equity, corporate debt and gilt funds. Ultrasafe investors are assumed to have put 60% in gilt funds, 40% in corporate bond funds and nothing in equity funds. A conservative investor would put 20% in stocks, 30% in corporate bonds and 50% in gilts. A balanced allocation would put 33.3% in each class of funds, while an aggressive investor would invest the maximum 50% in the equity fund, 30% in corporate bonds and 20% in gilts.

Ultra safe investors

Bond funds of the NPS have generated over 12% returns in the past one year, but the performance has not been good in recent months. The average G class gilt fund of the NPS has given 0.55% returns in the past six months. The change in the RBI stance on interest rates pushed up bond yields significantly in February, which led to a sharp decline in bond fund NAVs.

Before they hit a speed bump, gilt and corporate bond funds had been on a roll. Rate cuts in 2015-16 were followed by demonetisation, which boosted the returns of gilt and corporate bond funds. Risk-averse investors who stayed away from equity funds and put their corpus in gilt and corporate bond funds have earned rich rewards.

How to invest in NPS

Unsurprisingly, the LIC Pension Fund is the best performing pension fund for this allocation. “Team LIC has rich experience in the bond market and is perhaps the best suited to handle bond funds,” says a financial planner.

The gilt funds of NPS usually invest in long-term bonds and are therefore very sensitive to interest rate changes. Going forward, the returns from gilt and corporate bond funds will be muted compared to the high returns in the past.

Conservative investors

In the long term, a 100% debt allocation is unlikely to beat inflation. This is why financial planners advise that at least some portion of the retirement corpus should be deployed in equities. Conservative investors in the NPS, who put 20% in equity funds and the rest in debt funds, have also earned good returns. Though the short-term performance has been pulled down by the debt portion, the medium- and long-term performances are quite attractive.

Here too, LIC Pension Fund is the best performer because 80% of the corpus is in debt. It has generated SIP returns of 10.25% in the past 3 years. NPS funds for government employees also follow a conservative allocation, with a 15% cap on equity exposure.

How to apply for national pension scheme?

These funds have also done fairly well, beating the 100% debt-based EPF by almost 200-225 basis points in the past five years. Incidentally, the LIC Pension Fund for Central Government employees is the best performer in that category. Debt-oriented hybrid mutual funds, also known as monthly income plans, have given similar returns.

However, this performance may not be sustained in future. The equity markets could correct and the debt investments might also give muted returns.

Balanced investors

Balanced investors who spread their investments equally across all three fund classes have done better than the ultra-safe and conservative investors. The twin rallies in bonds and equities have helped balanced portfolios churn out impressive returns. Though debt funds slipped in the short term, the spectacular performance of equity funds pulled up the overall returns. Reliance Capital Pension Fund is the best performer in the past six months with 4.03% returns, but it is Kotak Pension Fund that has delivered the most impressive numbers over the long term. Its three-year SIP returns are 10.39% while five-year SIP returns are 11.22%. For investors above 40, the balanced allocation closely mirrors the Moderate Lifecycle Fund. This fund puts 50% of the corpus in equities and reduces the equity exposure by 2% every year after the investor turns 35. By the age of 43, the allocation to equities is down to 34%. However, some financial planners argue that since retirement is still 15-16 years away, a 42-43-year olds should not reduce the equity exposure to 34-35%. But it is prudent to start reducing the risk in the portfolio as one grows older.

Aggressive investors

Aggressive investors, who put the maximum 50% in equity funds and the rest in gilt and corporate bond funds have earned the highest returns, with stock markets touching their all-time highs. Kotak Pension Fund gave 16.3% returns in the past year. The best performing UTI Retirement Solutions has given SIP returns of 11.78% in five years. Though equity exposure has been capped at 50%, young investors can put in up to 75% of the corpus in equities if they opt for the Aggressive Lifecycle Fund. It was introduced late last year, (along with a Conservative Lifecycle Fund that put only 25% in equities), and investors who opted for it earned an average 10.8% in the past 6 months.

But the equity allocation of the Aggressive Lifecycle Fund starts reducing by 4% after the investor turns 35. The reduction slows down to 3% a year after he turns 45. Even so, by the late 40s, his allocation to equities is not very different from the Moderate Lifecycle Fund. Critics say investors should be allowed to invest more in equities if they want.

pension scheme interest rate: What is new pension scheme interest rate?,,"The pension scheme offered by the government of India known as the National Pension Scheme (NPS) is a voluntary contribution to the retirement savings designed to offer the subscribers a systematic saving after their job life. The NPS seeks to commence systematic saving after retirement among the senior citizens, as regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority ( PFRDA ), which manage all the operations of NPS.

Interest rates offered by NPS

It is a known fact that under the NPS, subscriber’s money is invested into a number of investment options. Moreover, the pension scheme does not offer a particular fixed interest rate. But generally, NPS schemes can earn a subscriber somewhere around 12-14 percent interest, which is still a lot more than other investment options.

NPS offers a number of investment options and the choice of Pension Fund Manager for planning the growth of your investments in a logical manner that will help you see your money grow, as stated on pfrda.org.in. A person can switch from one investment option to another or from one fund manager to another subject to some regulatory restrictions. The returns on NPS are completely depended on the market rates.

Businesses that have a turnover of less than Rs 1 crore or 75 lacs for particular states can go for this scheme. However, if on any day, the turnover crosses the stated limit, then businesses become ineligible and thus need to register under the regular scheme. What is the rate of composition in GST?

The rate of composition in GST ais 1% of the turnover for traders and other suppliers acceptable for the composition scheme registration, 2% of the turnover for manufacturers apart from manufacturers of products not covered under the GST composition scheme and 5% of the turnover for restaurant services. Who is not eligible for the GST composition scheme?

Big businesses in India are happy with the introduction of GST but small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups that don't have required resources and expertise to facilitate GST compliance procedures are having hard times.Therefore, to lower the burden of compliance for small businesses, a GST composition scheme has been introduced by the GST Council where the individuals have to pay tax at a minimum rate based on their turnover.Registering under the GST composition Scheme is optional and voluntary.

How to compute GST return?

This can be done by subtracting the comprehensive GST you have paid on your purchases and expenses (available on the box 14 on your return) from the holistic GST you have received from your sales and income (available on the box 10 on your return). How many GST returns are available to claim?

A regular business can file either monthly returns or annual returns under GST. The total of this comes to around 26 returns in a single financial year. How to calculate late fees for GST?

There is a penalty of 5% of the balance owing plus the 1% of your balance owing for each full month your return is late, subject to a maximum of 12-month time-period. Is GST computed on MRP?

Yes, MRP or maximum retail price is inclusive of all taxes including GST too. No retailer can charge GST over and above the MRP.

The new Goods and Services Tax (GST) has changed the way businesses use to bill their clients and or customers. If you are one those wondering how to calculate GST returns , here is a step by step guide for you:The first step is to find the exact slab rate for the goods or services under the GST Act. To find GST Rate , you will have to determine the type of supply item, i.e., whether is it a good or a service. If the supply is a good, find the HSN Code and if the transaction involves the supply of a service, then find the SAC Code.Once you know the HSN or SAC Code, then find out under which slab of GST tax rate the supply fits into. The GST Council has created 5 different slab rates at NIL/0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% for both goods and services.Once you know the GST rate, next find out the applicability of IGST or CGST and SGST. To do so, you need to determine the place of supply first. Mostly, the place where the supply of goods or services was done would be the address where the goods or the service was provided. But in case of e-commerce or OIDAR services, the determination of the place of supply is a more complex issue.Under GST rule, the supplier of the goods or service can collect tax from the recipient and remit the same to the government. However, there are some services like 'reverse charge services', where the recipient is made liable for payment of GST.According to new GST rules, suppliers must maintain extensive accounts, records and file 3 GST forms in a month. However, small businesses having a turnover of less than Rs 75 lakhs, can enrol under the GST Composition Scheme and pay a flat GST based on their aggregate turnover. You should check whether your supplier is enrolled under GST Composition Scheme or not.Next is to find out the type of transactions, for example - Business to Business; Business to Consumer where the value of supply is more than Rs 2.5 lakhs; or Business to Consumer where the value of supply is less than Rs 2.5 lakhs."
GST benefits: What are the advantages of GST ( Goods and Services Tax),,"Eliminates cascading effect of tax

GST has subsumed more than a dozen taxes that existed before the new tax regime. This helps in eliminating the cascading effect of taxes. Cascading effect refers to the situation where a taxpayer needs to pay taxes on taxes.

Higher threshold of taxpayers

Under the previous taxation system, any business with a turnover of more than Rs 5 lakh (in most states) was liable to pay VAT. Also, service tax was exempted for service providers with a turnover of less than Rs 10 lakh.

Under GST regime, however, this threshold has been increased to Rs 20 lakh, which exempts many small traders and service providers.

Small businesses

Over a period of time, government has provided reliefs to small businessmen and taxpayers as far as rate of tax and compliance of filing tax is concerned. Under GST, small businesses (with a turnover of Rs 20 to 75 lakh) can benefit as it gives an option to lower taxes by utilizing the Composition scheme. This move has brought down the tax and compliance burden on many small businesses.

Simpler and Lesser Number of Compliances

Compliance will be simpler through the harmonisation of tax rates, procedures, and laws. Synergies and efficiencies are expected across the board thanks to common formats/forms, common definitions, and common interface via the GST portal. Inter-state disputes such as those on e-commerce taxation and entry tax that currently prevail will no longer cause concerns, while multiple taxation on the same transactions will also be removed. Compliance costs will also reduce as a result.

The previous tax regime had service tax and VAT, and they both had their own compliances and returns. GST will merge them and lower the number of returns as well as the time spent on tax compliances. GST has around 11 returns under it. Four of them are basic returns that are applicable to all taxable entities under GST. Although the number of returns could increase, the main GSTR-1 shall be manually populated, while GSTR-2, GSTR-3, AND GSTR-4 shall be auto-populated.

GSTR1 Filing: What is GSTR1 &amp; How to File it Online?,,"What is meant by GSTR1?

Simply put, GSTR1 is a monthly statement of outward supplies to be crafted by all normal and casual registered taxpaying individuals who are engaged in outward supplying of goods and services and possess information related to these outward supplies. Is it mandatory to file GSTR1?

Business owners who have a comprehensive income of more than Rs 2,50,000 are required compulsorily to file income tax returns under GSTR1. How do GSTR1 and GSTR2 differ from each other?

While GSTR1 is the monthly statement of outward supplies of goods or services filed by registered individuals, the GSTR2 return reflects the accrual of the input tax credit from the inputs collected at some point of the prior month. What is the late fee for GSTR1?

The penalty or the late fee for not filing GSTR1 is Rs 200 per day that includes Rs 100 for CGST Act and Rs 100 for SGST Act.

GSTR-1 is a monthly or quarterly return to be filed by regular dealers, the return of which is divided into 13 sections. It is the base document upon which the entire compliance structure of GST is based.For traders with turnover upto Rs 1.5 crore annually, GSTR-1 needs to be filed on quarterly basis while that for traders having turnover above that needs to be filed every month. The late fee for filing GSTR-1 is Rs 50 per day after the due date, and Rs 20, in case of nil returns.Once GSTR-1 return is filed, a trader does not need to pay any tax immediately. The tax has to be paid at the time of filing GSTR-3B (until March 2018).Composition dealers need not file GSTR-1. Such traders need to file GSTR-4 every quarter.GSTR-1 is filed in FORM GSTR-1. The various details included in GSTR-1 are:(i) Invoice wise details of Inter-State and Intra-State supplies made to registered persons and Inter-State supplies with invoice value more than two and a half lakh rupees made to unregistered persons.(ii) Consolidated details of Intra-State supplies made to unregistered persons for each rate of tax and State wise Inter-State supplies with invoice value upto two and a half lakh rupees made to unregistered persons for each rate of tax.(iii) Debit and Credit notes, if any, issued during the month for invoices issued previously."

Samsung Pop Out Smartphone: Samsung may be working on a smartphone with pop-out display,,"After foldable phones, Samsung may be gearing up to launch phones with a new design that includes a flexible display that pops out. Samsung has reportedly filed a patent for a smartphone that comes with a flexible display that comes out of its chassis slightly. So, what’s the purpose of this? Samsung wants to put a loudspeaker resonance chamber within the tiny among of space created inside the body after the display pops out a bit, as per a report by LetsGoDigital .

“The telephone housing consists of a front and a rear panel, between which all components are placed. One or more speakers are placed directly under the front panel, as well as a microphone, a front camera module and various sensors.”

The idea is to make room for better speakers. The report claims that Samsung and LG have been looking at including better quality speakers to improve audio quality of their phones . The display will be made on plastic polymer, similar to the ones seen in Samsung’s foldable phones like the Galaxy Z Flip or Z Fold 2.

“These components can move with the front panel and flexible screen. The top part of the screen makes an inward folding movement, without the housing moving with it. This creates extra resonance space for the sound equipment within the housing,” said LetsGoDigital .

Samsung has not made anything official about this technology yet. While Samsung may or may not be working on a smartphone like this, there is no official word about it either.

Meanwhile, HTC may have plans for a foldable phone , if we go by a recent patent filing. Spotted by LetsGoDigital, the patent filing shows a smartphone with hinge in the middle. It seems like the fold would be horizontally in the middle.

After Apple added trackpad support to iPadOS via a software update, Microsoft announced that the entire Office apps on iPad will be compatible with Apple iPad trackpad by this fall. Keeping to its word, the company has started rolling out the full iPadOS cursor support to Office apps on iPad.

Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps on iPad can now take full advantage of Apple’s new Magic Keyboard trackpad or mouse with the latest version of iPadOS and Office apps. Microsoft says that the iPadOS cursor transforms into the tool users need depending on the content the cursor is pointing to. Also, common tasks such highlighting a text in word, changing the place of an image in PowerPoint, selecting a range in Excel, etc will be familiar to the PC or Mac version of the apps.

In addition to that, Microsoft has also updated these apps with new start screens and a new ribbon of feature menus. According to the company, this brings a much cleaner and more modern user interface to these apps. These changes are a part of the company's new Fluent UI design statement which can be seen across the Microsoft 365 experience.

Microsoft has confirmed that several users have already started receiving the update, however, it is a phased rollout and might take a couple of weeks to reach all users.

For those unaware, Microsoft has recently updated its Office apps on iPad with Split screen support allowing users to run Office apps on iPad in split screen view.

"OnePlus Watch launch postponed, may not come this year",,"OnePlus has been working on a smartwatch for some time now and the company was expected to launch its first smartwatch soon. However, a report by PhoneArena claims that the OnePlus Watch is not launching any time soon. In fact, it may not even launch in 2020. OnePlus is reportedly facing issues with software for the smartwatch which the company wants to perfect before launch.

Recently, a report by the XDA Developers claimed that a device with the name of “OnePlus Watch” was spotted on Indonesia’s regulatory body’s IMDA website. As per the listing, the device has been listed as a “Wearable Watch” name with model number W301GB. The listing also reveals that the wearable device will run on Google ’s WearOS operating system and powered by a Snapdragon Wear chipset.

The OnePlus smartwatch has been a topic of discussion since 2016. And there is no official word from the company yet.

Meanwhile, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei left the company. Pei is said to be leaving OnePlus to start his own venture and is in talks with investors to raise capital. OnePlus was co-founded in 2013 by Pete Lau and Carl Pei. He has been the face of the company since its inception.

OnePlus recently ventured into earbuds and power bank product categories and it is expected that the brand will expand its portfolio. But as far as the smartwatch is concerned, it may not happen right now.

Adobe adds content authenticity feature in Photoshop to fight deep fake photos,,"After the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) was announced last year, Adobe has finally introduced a new feature to fight deepfakes and other deceptively manipulated content. There’s a new attribution tool in Adobe Creative Cloud . This feature will be available to select users in pre-release within Photoshop and Behance initially.

The tool is built using an early version of the open standard that will provide a secure layer of tamper-evident attribution data to photos, including the author’s name, location and edit history. This will help users better understand the content they view online and understand whether it's fake or not.

This initiative is made in collaboration with The New York Times Company, Twitter, Microsoft, BBC, Qualcomm, Truepic, WITNESS, CBC and many others. “Collaborating with leaders across a variety of industries will help to create an industry-wide attribution framework, making it easier on consumers and creatives alike to use the tool,” said Adobe in a statement.

With a tamper-evident way, content creators can add their name to their creative work. Adobe believes, “The more creators distribute content with proper attribution, the more consumers will expect and use that information to make judgement calls, thus minimizing the influence of bad actors and deceptive content.”

Back in 2019, Adobe revealed that it is soon going to release a Photoshop Camera app to offer computation photography to all smartphones. The company previewed the Photoshop Camera app at the recently held MAX 2019 conference which brings the power of Photoshop directly into the camera app. That means you need not edit the photo after shooting, you can customise the photo and make it look original even while you are pointing the camera at a subject.

However, Adobe was concerned that “high-quality” photos with “Photoshop magic” might add to the problem of deep fakes in social media. It was then the company started working with researchers at UC Berkeley to create a tool for Adobe that will help recognise deep fakes and red flag manipulated images.

Samsung rolls out these Galaxy Fold 2 features to Galaxy Fold smartphone,,"South Korean tech giant Samsung has announced that it is rolling out a new software update to the Galaxy Fold that will enable it to offer some of the popular features of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2.

While the company has announced the update today, it has also specified that the launch date and available features may vary by carrier or region.

After this update, Galaxy Fold users will be able to launch up to three apps together in their preferred split-screen layout using App Pair functionality. Users will be able to access this feature via the Edge Panel, which combines the Multi-Window Tray with Edge Panel, said the company. Users will have to swipe the side of the screen to see up to 22 apps. “The arrangement of the Multi-Active Window layout can now be arranged horizontally, giving you added flexibility for multitasking,” added the company.

This update will also come with the option to connect the Galaxy Fold wirelessly to a Smart TV using Samsung DeX. Once the user taps on the Samsung DeX icon in the quick panel, they can customise the second screen as per their need with screen zoom and various font size options.

The camera upgrades on the Galaxy Fold include Auto framing and Capture View Mode. While the former is said to zoom in or out to track motion to keep the subject centrally framed, the latter is said to capture and review photos in real-time. It is said to show you up to five of the latest photos or videos on the left side of the Main Screen, while giving users a preview of their next shot on the other half. Another camera centric feature is Dual Preview, This feature allows users to show a preview of the image on both the Cover and main screens of Galaxy Fold. This feature also works with video in Pro Video mode.

Lastly, Galaxy Fold users will now get the option to directly share the password of the Wi-Fi you are connected to trusted Galaxy devices that are near them. The updated Wi-Fi feature can also show them the speed of nearby connections (Very Fast, Fast, Normal Slow) to help them find one that’s suitable.

Among all the most awaited Apple products, if there is one product that has been super hyped and talked about then it is Apple’s AirPower charging mat. With every event the company announces and hosts, rumours about this device from the Cupertino-based tech giant come back.Now, as per the latest input, AirPower is “dead” at least for 2021. This was claimed by reliable Apple tipster Jon Prosser who suggests that all AirPower prototyping has been removed from the schedule of 2021.Besides this, he also added, “Sources doubt that it’ll ever be picked back up again.”Apple on its part had already announced in March 2019 that it is pulling the plug on this device. While announcing the cancellation of the Apple AirPower mat Apple said, “After much effort, we've concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project. We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward.”This year, Apple has launched a MagSafe charger for wireless charging of its devices, however unlike the AirPower mat it charges one device at a time, whether it is iPhone or AirPods. Further, it isn’t compatible with Apple Watch.In India, the MagSafe charger that offers wireless charging up to 15W is priced at Rs 4,500 and can be purchased through Apple.com."
AMD: AMD to acquire Xilinx for $35 billion,,"Semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD ) said on Tuesday it would buy Xilinx Inc in a $35 billion all-stock deal, intensifying its battle with Intel Corp in the data center chip market.

The deal, which AMD expects to close at the end of 2021, will create a combined company with 13,000 engineers and a completely outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).

The two U.S. firms have benefited from a more nimble approach to grab market share from Intel, which has struggled with internal manufacturing.

AMD has long been Intel's chief rival for central processor units (CPUs) in the personal computer business.

Since Chief Executive Lisa Su took over AMD in 2014, she has focused on challenging Intel in the fast-growing business of data centers that power internet-based applications and services and are fuelling the rise of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation telecommunications networks.

Xilinx has also been working to penetrate data centers with programmable processors that help speed up specialized tasks such as compressing videos or providing digital encryption. Its primary rival in the area, Altera Corp, was scooped up by Intel for $16.7 billion in 2015 in what was then Intel's largest-ever deal.

""There are some areas where we're very strong, and we will be able to accelerate some of the adoption of the Xilinx product family,"" Su told Reuters in an interview. ""And there are some areas where (Xilinx CEO) Victor (Peng) is very strong, and we believe that we'll be able to accelerate some of the AMD products into those markets.""

The tie-up comes at a time when Intel's manufacturing technology has fallen years behind TSMC's. AMD, which spun off its factories nearly a decade ago, has rocketed ahead of Intel with chips that perform better. The performance edge helped AMD gain its best market share since 2013 at slightly less than 20% of the CPU market, which has in turn pushed its shares up 79% this year.

Shares of AMD fell about 4% in premarket trading, while those of Xilinx surged over 12% after the deal was announced.

Xilinx also uses TSMC's factories, called ""fabs"" in the industry, to make its chips, with both U.S. companies using modular designs that let them swap out different pieces of a chip to avoid bottlenecks or delays.

""We ended up with TSMC, and have stayed with them, not due to any contractual reason - we could go to any fab at any time - but because they are best-in-class,"" Peng told Reuters in an interview. ""It's about the choices you make.""

Under the deal, Xilinx shareholders will receive about 1.7 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock, valuing Xilinx at $143 per share, or about 24.8% higher than its $114.55 closing price on Oct. 26. AMD shareholders will own about 74% of the combined firm, with Xilinx shareholders owning the remaining 26%.

AMD's Su will lead the combined company as chief executive, with Xilinx's Peng serving as president responsible for the Xilinx business and strategic growth initiatives. The companies expect the deal to generate $300 million in cost savings.

AMD also reported earnings on Tuesday earlier than scheduled. It reported revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.80 billion and 41 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of $2.57 billion and 36 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said there is a danger that a major acquisition in an adjacent chip market could distract AMD's leadership while Intel fights to regain market share.

""The worry would be, AMD has this great self-grown story of their own, which is just starting to play out. Why are you doing this now? Is it just opportunistic? Does it distract from the current story?"" he said.

Xilinx's Peng, however, said meetings between the two companies have already revealed they have very similar methods for designing chips.

""I'll be honest, I don't think it's really as challenging as some other combinations,"" he said. ""I had one of my leadership teams who was not familiar with AMD say to me after a meeting, 'Boy, they're just like us.'""

Facebook India public policy director Ankhi Das resigns,,"Facebook Inc’s top India lobbyist Ankhi Das has quit, the U.S. tech giant said on Tuesday, months after a political controversy erupted over how the popular social media network regulates political content in the country.

Das, who was Facebook’s public policy head for India, South & Central Asia, has decided to step down to pursue her interest in public service, the company said in a statement.

Facebook and Das drew criticism from left-leaning opposition lawmakers after The Wall Street Journal newspaper in August reported that she opposed applying hate-speech restrictions to some Hindu nationalist individuals and groups, fearing damage to Facebook’s business prospects.

After the article, Facebook India head Ajit Mohan defended Das and the company’s policies in an internal community post seen by Reuters.

The WSJ “article does not reflect the person I know or the extraordinarily complex issues we face everyday that benefits from Ankhi and the Public Policy team’s expertise,” Mohan wrote.

The matter also prompted Facebook employees to question whether proper content regulation policies were being followed in India, leaving the company battling a public relations and political crisis.

Das was considered among India’s most influential corporate lobbying executives and had been central to Facebook’s rise in India since joining the company in 2011.

“Ankhi was one of our earliest employees in India and played an instrumental role in the growth of the company and its services,” Facebook said in a statement announcing Das’s departure.

iPhone: Apple A15 Bionic chipset may use TSMC’s N5P node: Report,,"The A14 Bionic is Apple’s latest chipset that powers the iPhone 12 models. While the iPhone 12 arrived in international markets some days back, rumours about the next Apple chip have already been set in motion.

"Apple iPhone 12 buyers, here’s how much you actually need to spend to use fastest MagSafe charging",,"Apple has introduced a new way to wirelessly charge your iPhone 12 with MagSafe . It is basically a wireless charger that offers up to 15W fast charging and magnetically attaches to iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models. It is reliable and you can continue to use your iPhone 12 while it gets charged wirelessly.

The MagSafe charger costs Rs 4,500 in India. But if you think that by just paying Rs 4,500 you will get the entire wireless fast charging experience then you are wrong. After paying for your brand new iPhone 12, the most logical purchase is to get a case or cover to protect your iPhone 12, which is made of glass. Now, this is where things become a bit tricky.

Any random case or cover will not support MagSafe charging. You will have to buy a MagSafe compatible case for the iPhone 12. The cost of the MagSafe case for iPhone 12 and 12 Pro starts at Rs 4,900. With the case and MagSafe charger you can wireless charge as well as protect your new iPhone 12 or 12 Pro from accidental falls. But what about the charging speeds?

If you want to get the fastest wireless charging speed, which is 15W, then you will have to spend another Rs 1,900 for the 20W USB-C power adapter from Apple.

So, in total you will have to spend Rs 11,300 for the entire MagSafe experience-- Rs 4,500 for the MagSafe charger + Rs 4,900 for a MagSafe compatible case from Apple + Rs 1,900 for the 20W USB-C power adapter.

Now, if you are thinking that you may use your MacBook’s 96W power adapter to fast charge your iPhone 12 using MagSafe then you are wrong. Reports claim that you can only get 15W charging if you use Apple’s 20W USB-C adapter. For every other adapter you will most likely get 10W charging. If you think of using Android adapters, then you will get even slower speeds of around 6W.

If you don’t buy the MagSafe compatible case and opt for a cheaper case/cover instead, then you will have to take your iPhone 12 out of the case everytime you want to use the MagSafe charger. Also, if you don’t buy the 20W adapter, it is better to use the cable to charge, as it will be quicker.

What’s so special about the MagSafe? The problem with most wireless chargers is that while the device is charging you will not be able to use it. You even have to be careful that you don’t touch it at all as a slight touch may interrupt the wireless charging process.This is the major problem that Apple has solved with MagSafe. The company has added a coil inside the new iPhone 12 range and added magnets to the charger itself. This enables a magnetic lock between the new iPhone 12 models and the MagSafe charger. Now, as the MagSafe charger is connected to the wall socket via an adapter, you can use the iPhone as well.

Note that you will be able to wirelessly charge iPhone 8 and above models with the MagSafe charger. Also, you can charge your AirPods. But note that the magnetic alignment is only there on iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models. It will be a hassle to charge older iPhones or AirPods with MagSafe as you will have to place the device on top of the charger and leave it for charging ensuring that no sudden movement stops the charging process.

Why anti-China wave may have given the smartphone market a ‘miss’,,"It’s been almost 90 days since the government of India banned 59 Chinese apps to ‘retaliate’ against the simmering tensions at the border with China. Since then — and perhaps even before that — the anti-China sentiment has been manifesting across industries. One market where China dominates in India is the smartphone and despite the geopolitical situation, the Chinese brands continue to rule the roost in the country.Navkendar Singh, research director, Client Devices & IPDS, IDC India, says that if you keep the politics aside for a moment and think then what choice does a consumer have? IDC did a dipstick survey sometime in June and July this year to gauge the anti-China sentiment. “7 out of 10 consumers asked for a non-Chinese phone but only two ended up buying,” Singh illustrates his point with an example.Shilpi Jain, research analyst, Counterpoint Research, deals that the Chinese brands’ local manufacturing, value-for-money offerings leaves consumers very few options to choose from. “They have spoilt the consumers by giving them what they want,” Singh says in agreement with Jain.Prabhu Ram, head, industry intelligence group, CMR, says that there is undoubtedly a strong anti-China sentiment. “While the emotions are running very high, this is yet to potentially translate into a definitive negative economic impact on Chinese trade.”A recent report by Canalys reveals that collectively Chinese vendors hold 76% of the market shipments in Q3 2020. This number, interestingly, was 74% in the same quarter last year. “Ongoing tension between India and China has been a hot topic in the past few months, but we have yet to see a significant impact on purchase decisions of mass-market customers,” says Canalys Research Analyst, Varun KannanAs far as market share is concerned in Q3 2020, Xiaomi leads it with 26.1% whereas Samsung claimed about 20.1% market share in the country. Vivo , Realme and Oppo garnered 17.6%, 17.1% and 12.4% respectively.According to Counterpoint’s research for the quarter between April-June, Chinese brands’ market share fell from 81% to 72%. However, it would be inaccurate to attribute this decline to the anti-China sentiment. “There were other supply-related issues too which impacted Chinese brands share like manufacturing constraints due to labour immigration,” says Jain. For instance, Oppo’s factory was shut for almost 20 days after COVID cases found in factory and at last, components were held up at custom on the basis of country origin in last week of June, she adds.IDC report for Q2 2020 had Xiaomi as the market leader with 29.4 per cent share ahead of Samsung, who commanded 26.4 per cent of the market. The other three spots in the top 5 went to three other Chinese brands — Vivo, Realme, and Oppo.A look at the numbers for the past few years tells us that Xiaomi -- and other Chinese brands’ -- dominance began sometime around Q2 of 2017. It was Samsung that was ruling the roost then with 24% market share whereas Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo had 16%, 13% and 10% share respectively. In Q4 2017, Xiaomi overtook Samsung for the first time to become the market leader by garnering 25% market share. Since then it hasn’t looked back while Oppo and Vivo have also gone from strength to strength. In 2017, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo had a combined market share of 37%. Do note, this doesn’t include other Chinese brands such as Huawei, Lenovo-owned Motorola, and others. In 2018, the top 3 Chinese brands consolidated their position and garnered over 43% market share. In 2019, the number had increased to more than half the market share and close to 52%. Realme, another Chinese, brand entered the top 5 smartphone players for the first time in 2019 as well.When it comes to smartphones, there is also a retail strategy at play. Both online and offline retailers depend a lot on the Chinese players. Singh makes a valid point when he says that if you are a retailer then if not Oppo, Vivo or Xiaomi, what will you sell? “Samsung has gained market share in India because of this but long-term the Chinese brands aren’t going to suffer as such,” believes Singh.There has been a sense that the anti-China sentiment could inject new life in domestic brands like Micromax and Lava. Singh believes that there is a willingness (on part of Indian brands) but the ability to fight the Chinese brands remains questionable. Jain, however, thinks that the government’s PLI scheme might give domestic brands a window of opportunity. Ram of CMR, on the other hand, believes that the domestic brands have a certain brand equity but “the path to a successful comeback is tough and uncertain.”If the smartphone brands from China haven’t been adversely impacted, then it’s down to two things, as per experts. Lack of choice and more importantly when it comes to spending money from your pocket, then most consumers will go for the best choice. “Consumers don’t have much choice as only Samsung is the only brand currently which has products across all price tiers,” adds Jain. Singh believes that when it comes to spending money from their pockets, people will buy what’s good for them irrespective of the country of origin. “All the talk on social media and WhatsApp is fine but the reality is different,” he adds."
Buying a smart speaker: What you should know,,"Smart speakers are one of the most advertised audio products in recent times in India. While the thought of ta... Read More

Smart speakers are one of the most advertised audio products in recent times in India. While the thought of talking to a device and getting replies sounds cool there are certain things you should know. Understand that if the thought of talking to an AI-enabled voice mesmerises you, then you can do the same thing on your smartphone as well. But if you want to control other devices in your house then a smart speaker makes more sense. The fact that you are reading this article means somewhere you are not sure enough about the utility of smart speakers. Here are things you should know before you buy your first smart speaker.

Most smart speakers are under-utilised and you should have a plan to keep you excited enough to keep using them.

There are three types of smart speakers available with three different AI voice assistants in India that make sense. Buy an Amazon Echo device for Alexa or a Google Nest device for using Google Assistant and finally to use Siri , you can get the Apple HomePod. In case you want both Alexa and Google Assistant support, then opt for third-party speakers. Of course, there’s Microsoft's assistant called Cortana but there are very few speaker options like the Harman Kardon Invoke.

What can smart speakers do?

There are two broad use cases of a smart speaker. If you are just going to buy a smart speaker then you could use voice commands to change music, change volume, listen to news, ask questions, get directions, set reminders or alarms, get weather updates, listen to podcasts and more. You may not even need to touch your phone to get these activities done.

The second use case is where you can actually use your voice to control lights, fans, AC and other appliances in your room. It doesn’t matter whether your appliance is smart or not. But to do this, you would need to buy an universal remote like Oak Remote or buy sensors and other smart switches. This is the scenario where buying a smart speaker makes complete sense as you will be able to get the most out of it.

Just imagine you walk into your kitchen and say, “Alexa, turn on the kitchen” to your Echo Dot speaker. This simple voice command can carry out multiple functions like switching on the lights, turning on the electric chimney, music of your choice and may even pour a cup of coffee, if programmed.

Taking another instance, say you have an old AC model and regular tube lights in your home connected to an universal remote like Oak Remote. With a smart speaker, you can control these lights and appliances with voice. Just say “Alexa, set AC to 19” and the job gets done. Note that you do not need to buy new appliances to make your home smart. Simply buying an universal remote along with smart switches and a smart speaker can add voice support to almost all appliances.

If you are looking to get things done in house by just talking to a speaker then it goes without saying that a smart speaker can work wonders. On the other hand, if you are not keen on making your home smart then the use cases are limited.

Alexa or Ok Google or Hey Siri

If you are looking at a smart home setup then getting an Alexa or Google Assistant enabled speaker is a reliable bet. The capabilities of Siri are limited. In fact, the debate is mostly restricted to Alexa or Google Assistant. While the features are similar, Alexa supports more smart home devices and it is easier to use Alexa commands. Google is trying to catch up but Alexa offers a reliable experience.

Now, if you don’t want to configure your smart home, opting for the Siri-enabled Apple HomePod or HomePod Mini makes more sense if you are looking for quality audio that is assuming that you are already familiar with the Apple ecosystem. If you don’t own an iPhone it goes without saying that you don’t buy an Apple smart speaker. For Android phone users, you can either opt for an Amazon Echo or Google Nest speaker. Both offer a very similar experience when it comes to getting basic things done. But in case, if you ever plan to add voice to everything in your home, getting an Alexa speaker makes it a better deal.

Qualcomm: Qualcomm partners with audio firm for hearing enhancement software,,"Qualcomm Technologies International has collaborated with Jacoti , an audio technology company, to bring Jacoti’s hearing enhancement software to the Qualcomm QCC5100 Series Ultra-Low Power Bluetooth SoCs. Available for true wireless earbuds and Bluetooth headsets, this integration, the companies believe, will add accurate personalised hearing assistance with additional safety features.

As per Jacoti, its technology comes with a self-administered hearing test that prompts various tones and frequencies, to establish volume thresholds for the user’s level of hearing. Two audiograms are then created, tailored specifically to the user’s right and left ears, acting as the user’s individual hearing prescription based on their level of individual hearing.

These audiograms, in conjunction with the Jacoti technology, will work on devices featuring the Qualcomm QCC5100 Series SoCs and across multiple devices, with the software claimed to intercept the incoming sound before it reaches the user’s ears and then adjusting the volume of the appropriate frequencies to compensate for the user’s individual hearing deficiencies. The software on the device is also claimed to prevent the user from exposure to sounds that can cause further hearing damage.

“By working with Jacoti, we’re making hearing enhancement and personalization technology more accessible to consumers than ever before. For our customers, who are competing in a rapidly changing and crowded market, exciting technologies like this will provide a really interesting way to differentiate and enrich the end user experience, ” said James Chapman, vice president and general manager, Voice, Music & Wearables, Qualcomm Technologies International, Ltd.

Microsoft’s latest Xbox gaming consoles are now official and are set to go on sale starting November 10 globally. But it seems that the company has another inexpensive gaming device in production. Xbox head Phil Spencer has hinted towards new hardware for gamers which is mainly focused on Xbox xCloud game streaming service.

According to the hint, the new device is expected to be an Xbox xCloud streaming stick device like Amazon Fire TV Stick or other media-centric devices that directly plug into the HDMI port of the television and draws power from the USB port.

In a conversation with Stratechery (via The Verge), Spencer mentioned that these kinds of hardware can take the form of a streaming stick, or any other portable form factor and they will also be relatively cheaper compared to the upcoming Xbox Series S and Series X gaming consoles. Spencer also indicated the inclusion of Xbox Game Pass subscription with these devices to allow users stream and play their favourite titles on their TV.

Microsoft has not confirmed any other details about the streaming device such as name, features, requirements and pricing. The company was earlier rumoured to launch a game streaming stick back in 2016 and was expected to cost around $99. We may get to see the cheaper Xbox hardware next year.

For those unaware, Sony is also expected to expand its PS Now gaming subscription service to more countries including India soon. The new service allows users to streaming their PlayStation games on compatible devices and also brings several other benefits.

"Apple may launch new entry-level AirPods, AirPods Pro in 2021",,"Rumours suggest that Apple may launch two new models of AirPods in 2021

Unless there’s a surprise up its sleeve, it looks like Apple is more or less done with the 2020 launches. Rumours about a MacBook launch are doing the rounds but that remains to be seen. With 2020 launches almost out of the way, the rumour mills have starting churning about what 2021 might have in store. A report by Bloomberg suggests that Apple may launch a new entry-level AirPods and an upgraded AirPods Pro next year.

As per the report, the upcoming entry-level AirPods could feature. Design which is similar to the current AirPods Pro. This could mean a shorter stem and replaceable ear tips could be a part of the new AirPods. The report also says that Apple is rumoured to be working on improving the battery life of the AirPods. Also, as per Bloomberg, the entry-level AirPods will just have the design element of the AirPods Pro. In terms of features like noise-cancellation, they might not make their way to the entry-level AirPods.

As far as the second-gen AirPods Pro are concerned, the Bloomberg report states that Apple is looking at a design overhaul. The short stem that is currently there in the AirPods Pro could be totally removed. The report says that a design is being tested and it has a more rounded shape. Something like what we have already seen in wireless earbuds from the likes of Samsung and Google.

The report also mentions that features like noise-cancellation, wireless antennas could prove challenging to fit in a smaller case for the AirPods Pro. In other words, nothing has been finalised yet as far as the AirPods Pro’s next model is concerned. Having said that, leaks and rumours posted by Bloomberg have proven to be more ore less accurate in the past.

Google has removed three popular apps aimed for kids from Google Play Store for violating the company’s data collection policies .

TechCrunch has reported that Princess Salon, Number Coloring and Cats & Cosplay apps have been removed from Play Store after International Digital Accountability Council (IDAC), a nonprofit organisation based out of Boston highlighted that these three apps were found collecting Android ID and Android Advertising ID (AAID) and hence violating Google’s data collection policies.

According to the report, these apps were not directly associated with data collection. Reportedly the issue was with the frameworks -- Unity, Appodeal and Umeng that were powering the apps. The frameworks were collecting the Android ID and AAID from the kids’ phone and that’s a direct violation of Google’s policies.

In response to the issue, Google clearly stated that it takes action against any app that violates policy and in this case, Princess Salon, Number Coloring and Cats & Cosplay apps have broken the policy of not using developer kits that aren’t approved for ‘child-directed services’.

"Samsung: Samsung and Stanford researchers develop 10,000 PPI OLED display",,"Researchers from Stanford University and Samsung have managed to create a 10,000PPI OLED display , as per a Stanford blog post. The new display architecture is reportedly better than modern displays when it comes to PPI. Modern day smartphones have got a PPI (pixel-per-inch) range that hasn’t even reached 1,000PPI.

The display could arrive on future TVs, smartphones and VR/AR devices. As per the blog post, such high resolution displays would be especially beneficial for the VR/AR devices with their screens inches away from our eyes. The more the pixel density, the more compactly they are packed per inch, which is said to lead to more life-like, sharp and realistic images. The 10,000PPI display is also claimed to be brighter and have more colour accuracy than the current displays.

As per the blog post: “The advance is based on research by Stanford University materials scientist Mark Brongersma in collaboration with the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT).

“We’ve taken advantage of the fact that, on the nanoscale, light can flow around objects like water. The field of nanoscale photonics keeps bringing new surprises and now we’re starting to impact real technologies. Our designs worked really well for solar cells and now we have a chance to impact next generation displays.”, the post quotes Brongersma.

These benefits include access to the latest titles, free games and more.Microsoft Xbox comes with Xbox Game Pass, while Sony PlayStation has its own PS Plus subscription-based service. Although both the services are meant for the same purpose, their execution is opposite. Let’s put them side-by-side and see which one offers more benefits and is better value-for-money.Pricing is among the most important factors here and Xbox Game Pass certainly feels ahead of the PS Plus. The Game Pass service can be topped over the monthly Xbox Live Gold subscription by paying just Rs 489 per month for console and PC. The Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs Rs 699 per month that also includes Xbox Gold Live membership and offers all the benefits of it to the users. The Ultimate Game Pass also works on PC.Sony PS Plus subscription costs Rs 499 per month, Rs 1,199 for 3 months and a yearly subscription will cost Rs 2,999.Monthly pricing for both the subscription services cost around Rs 500 and are neck-to-neck.The argument over offering a better selection of games between the two consoles is a never-ending battle and perhaps almost impossible to answer. So, let’s say it depends upon the user. Xbox Game Pass and PS Benefits are totally different from each other, but both have their pros and cons.The PS Plus subscription is more focused on offering quality benefits rather than quantity, while Xbox Game Pass focuses more on quantity. Sony offers two free premium titles for free every month to PS Plus subscribers and they can play the game as long as they have an active PS Plus membership. For example, this month Need for Speed Payback and Vampyr are the two free games for PS Plus subscribers. In addition to that, PS Plus subscription also offers online multiplayer gameplay.Xbox Game Pass, on the other hand, offers access to over 100 high-quality console and PC games which players can play as much as they want. Microsoft-exclusive titles arrive on Game Pass the day of its launch and players can play the game without any additional cost. In addition to this, the entire collection gets shuffled time-to-time. Some popular titles include Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, The Witcher 3, GTA V, Doom Eternal, Forza Motorsports, Batman Arkam Knight and more.The major difference between the two services is the execution. PS Plus games get added to the users' collection forever. While on Xbox, users can only play the game till the time it is a part of Game Pass collection. It is more likely that you might have to say goodbye to the title you love to play eventually.Few things are common between both the subscriptions such as exclusive discounts on select games, add-ons, pre-orders and more. However, Xbox Game Pass has a slight edge here as it offers Xbox Live Gold subscription depending upon the tier. Starting November 10, the Game Pass Ultimate will also include EA Play subscription at no additional cost. This will give users access to hundreds of EA Game titles as well.There’s no clear cut winner here as both services are very different when it comes to benefits, so everything depends upon the use case scenario. If you are someone who loves to build a huge library of quality games and love playing online multiplayer titles, PS Plus subscription is the one for you. However, if you love trying new titles especially from EA and Microsoft-exclusives then Xbox Game Pass makes more sense here. Xbox Game Pass also works for PCs running Windows 10 operating system and ever updating libraries and more extensive titles does give it a slight edge over PS Plus."
Three important numbers that prove Google is 'everywhere' in your life,,"Google is omnipresent in the lives of those who use smartphones, laptops or tablets. There’s no getting ‘away’ from the Sundar Pichai-led company. Be it search, Maps, Gmail, internet browsing — it’s mainly all about Google, Google and Google. Still, sometimes you need numbers to prove how dependent people are on Google or how the company is literally everywhere in your life.Let’s start with Search. Google is so dominant that ‘Google’ it has become a part of the lexicon. There are, of course, other search engines. DuckDuckGo for the ‘hipsters’ and those who value privacy. There’s Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia whereas Bing and Yahoo are amongst the ‘popular’ search engines. Google, however, towers above them all. As per StatCounter, a database of global stats related to search, browsing and others, Google Search had a whopping 92.2% market share in September 2020. Bing had 2.8% share, Yahoo had 1.5% while Baidu, DuckDuckGo and Yandex rounded off the top 5.Now, let’s take a look at the browser market share where Google’s offering is the widely popular Chrome. Compared to Search, Google isn’t that dominant but a clear leader by some distance. Chrome , as per StatCounter, had a market share of 66% in September 2020. Apple ’s Safari browser came second with around 16% market share followed by Mozilla Firefox. Samsung Internet, Microsoft Edge and Opera complete the top 5 browsers in the world.Moving on, Search and Chrome are primarily used on smartphones and here too Google is the dominant player, thanks to Android . StatCounter pegs Android’s market share at close to 74%. This means almost three in every four smartphone users have an Android-based phone. Apple’s iOS had close to 24% market share while Samsung and others have minuscule share in the OS market.Browsing, search and mobile OS — three areas where Google is a dominant player and hence literally everywhere in people’s lives."
Here’s how desi PUBG Mobile rival FAU-G may look like,,"Today we celebrate the victory of good over evil, and what better day to celebrate our Fearless and United Guards,… https://t.co/gtHlP25YCH — Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) 1603630800000

The first glimpse of the desi PUBG Mobile rival game called FAU-G has been released. Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar tweeted a short video of what appears to be an in-game campaign depicting the clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Galwan valley earlier this year. But there’s no official word yet as to when the game will actually be available.For those unaware, FAU-G is an upcoming Indian mobile game based on heroics of the Indian armed forces. It was first released in September soon after the Indian government banned PUBG Mobile-- one of the most popular smartphone games. FAU-G, stands for Fearless And United-Guards, the game will be made by Bengaluru-based mobile game publisher nCORE Games and backed by Goqii CEO Vishal Gondal and Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar.The game is expected to launch on both Android and iOS and similar to other games, this one will also be free to play with in-app purchases. The developer, nCORE Games, claims to be a partner of Rovio on its website but nothing much is known about games made by them.While very little is known about the gameplay, FAU-G will be a first person shooter game and may be made similar to PUBG Mobile. Different modes and campaigns are expected to be its USP. However, there may not be a battle royale mode in FAU-G to begin with. The developers are expected to add it later. As for the availability, reports suggest that the game may come to Google Play and App Store in November."
12-year old threatened with jail for missing Zoom class: Report,,"The report quotes Mark Mastrov, the father of the boy, as saying that he received a letter from the school pri... Read More

A 12-year old student of Stanley Middle School, San Francisco, California was allegedly threatened with jail term after he skipped three Zoom class sessions of 30 minutes each on a single day, as per a report by The Mercury News.

The report quotes Mark Mastrov, the father of the boy, as saying that he received a letter from the school principal in which his son was threatened with consequences, including jail time.

The father also reportedly added that his is not the only such case; other parents in the district have received similar letters.

“Out of the blue, we got this letter. It said my son had missed classes, and at the bottom it referenced a state law which said truants can go to jail for missing 90 minutes of class. I called the school and said, ‘Hey, I want to clear this up."", the report quotes Mastrov.

As per the father, his son does not miss his classes, ever and it may be the case that he got a bit late and logged on after the roll call was taken.

According to Betsy Balmat, the principal of the school, if a student is absent from class, the school will make up to three automatic calls to the parent or guardian.

“If we have not heard back after three of those, we send a letter,” the principal adds.

California does have a new law that enables school districts to take action against students who miss their classes.

As per the state education code, a student is considered truant if he/she is absent from school ""without a valid excuse three full days in a single school year, if consistently tardy or if absent for more than a 30-minute period during the school day without a valid excuse on three occasions in a single school year.""

Penalty for such truancy includes make-up classes, paying fines and even jail time.

The father of the 12-year old, however, reportedly denies having got any calls before the letter arrived.

China has ‘good news’ for Apple despite tensions with US,,"

The latest iPhone 12 models seem to be an instant hit in China with people queuing up outside Apple ’s flagship store in Beijing to buy. Despite tensions between China and the US, sentiments of Chinese consumers are not much affected by Donald Trump ’s anti-China stance.

As a report by the South China Morning Post , “compared with last year’s iPhone 11 line of phones, the iPhone 12 line is showing strong demand in China.” The report further stated that this increased demand for 5G enabled iPhones despite “stiff competition “is a testament to the continuing power Apple has to draw in Chinese consumers even as tensions with the US have intensified.” China is one of the biggest markets for iPhones globally. TF Securities International analyst Kuo Ming-Chi estimates that China will account for up to 40% of global demand for the iPhone 12 Pro.

The new iPhone 12 costs more in China than the US due to local taxes and tariffs. Despite higher prices, people in China are even spending more to be among the first ones to get their hands on the new iPhones. In fact, on the first day of the sale, some people were even reselling brand new iPhones at up to 1000 yuan (around Rs 11,000) more to buyers who were waiting in the queue in front of the Apple store.

One of the reasons for the demand in China could be the new compact size of the iPhone 12 Mini. The South China Morning Post quoting a buyer said, “Android phones are often too big. The iPhone 12 is a tribute to the classic iPhone 5s and is much lighter and thinner, and the user experience is also way better than on Android phones.”

This is interesting as people are paying almost double the price of 5G-enabled Android phones from Oppo, Xiaomi , Huawei and Chinese players for size and experience.

How Google paid ‘tribute’ to Pele on his 80th birthday,,"Football legend Pele turned 80 this October 23. To commemorate his birthday, Google added a special easter egg to the bottom of the search page when someone searched for “Pelé” or “Pele.” The “Goooooooooogle” that’s seen at the bottom of the search results was replaced with “Gooooooooooal” in an alternating green/yellow pattern, the colours of the national football team of Brazil .If you observe the photo minutely, the link that would take you page 10 of the search results was marked as “#10”, the number of Pele’s jersey during his Santos FC and the New York Cosmos days. The “o” just about the #10 was replaced with a football and when you click the number, an animation of the letter “a” kicking the football to the “G” starts. “G” kicks the ball into the goal (wrapped around letter “I”), in a nod to Pele’s bicycle kick, after which the G and all the o’s erupt in jubilation, hinting at them representing players. If you count the letters from G to o, excluding the a and the I, it comes out to be 11, which most probably signifies a football eleven.The easter egg stayed on the search results on October 24 also and it is not yet known when it would be replaced with the usual “Goooooooooogle” seen at the bottom of every search result."
"What you will pay for iPhone 12, 12 Pro in these countries",,"Apple’s iPhone 12 series has been quite the talk of tech town since their launch just over 10 days back. The one thing — a perennial talking point with iPhones — which is unsurprisingly on most people’s minds is the pricing. The iPhone 12 Pro range, at least in India, starts at Rs 1.19 lakh whereas the iPhone 12 (not the mini) is close to Rs 80,000. Apple has to pay customs and taxes in India which does make the iPhone expensive than most other countries. Buying an iPhone from other countries — if possible — has always been a cheaper option.To put the simple conversion rule and you will see that the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are perhaps the most expensive in India when compared to most other popular smartphone markets. For instance, the iPhone 12 (128GB variant) in the US starts at $879. If you add taxes then it will cost close $940, which converted to Indian rupee would be roughly Rs 70,000. The iPhone 12 in India starts at Rs 79,900 for the 64GB variant. The 128GB variant costs Rs 84,900.The same goes for countries like China, Japan, UK, Russia — where the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are cheaper than what they cost in India. The government of India had hiked the GST rate from 12% to 18% which made the iPhone costlier. Not only that, but import duties on certain components were also hiked, which led to iPhones costing more.Having said that, Apple’s iPhones now are available across the price range for those looking for premium phones costing above Rs 40,000. From the iPhone SE to iPhone 12 Pro Max, Apple now has an iPhone from as ‘low’ as Rs 40,000 to as high as Rs 1.3 lakh."

google meet: Google Meet crosses 50 million downloads on Google Play Store,,"Google’s video conferencing platform -- Meet -- has hit 50 million downloads on Google Play Store.

The platform, which recently became free for everyone, has been part of Google’s G Suite productivity solution for organisations including businesses and schools. Now, it is freely available through both web and via apps on both Android and iOS devices.

Earlier this month, Javier Soltero, vice president & GM, G Suite, said in a blog post the platform had been adding millions of users daily which is why they decided to make it free. ""Last month, we were adding roughly 3 million new users every day. That's why we're expanding the offering to more people around the world.""

With 50 million downloads and 3 million daily new users, there is still no idea on the daily active users of Google’s platform. Microsoft Teams was said to have crossed a 75 million daily active user count last month leading to a 70% jump in the user base.

In March, one of the most popular video conferencing platforms — Zoom — claimed that its user base had grown to over 300 million daily users in the last three weeks. Following that, it admitted that the figure reprint the daily users but daily Zoom meeting participants, as The Verge.

The report also added that Zoom made the change on the blog post and even added a note admitting the error. “This blog originally referred to meeting participants as “users” and “people.” This was an oversight on our part,” reads the note.

Facebook too has also made its recently announced Messenger Rooms freely available to all last week. Right now, the option to create a Messenger Room is available in Messenger app for everyone and in the Facebook app for users in the US. However, the company is soon going to make it available for WhatsApp and Instagram users too.

Amazon Alexa Hindi: Amazon Alexa to soon get support for Hindi language,,"NEW DELHI: The e-commerce major Amazon introduced uts virtual voice assistant Alexa along with the Echo devices in India in 2017. Since its launch, the company has been rolling out updates which added India specific features and skills to it.

Amazon has now revealed another important feature which it will be bringing to its virtual assistant. The company said that it is bringing support for regional languages capabilities in Alexa for the Indian market. The regional language support will bring also add support for Hindi language.

The company said that the support for Hindi language in Alexa is in early stages of progress. The company claims that making Alexa speak Hindi is an easy process but the real challenge is to make Alexa understand the different accents and the form of language that is spoken in a particular region. Alexa has to be equipped to understand this and then react accordingly.

Moreover, Amazon wants to make Alexa more natural and conversational with humans with the help on machine learning. Presently, Alexa can understand some Hinglish commands. Amazon is also planning to introduce a feature using which users will be able to respond to Alexa's English statements in different languages such as Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, Kannada, Gujarati, Telugu and other regional languages.

Talking about the new development, Rohit Prasad, VP, and head scientist for Alexa said, ""Yes, we are working on infusing regional languages capabilities in Alexa for the Indian market but these are early days. For us, it is a contextual, cultural as well as content-related challenge as the question is not that Alexa just needs to understand Hindi. This part we can do relatively easily but Alexa needs to be Indian when it speaks in Hindi as there are several dialects and accents out there which Alexa has to understand and react accordingly.""

Google assistant: Here's how Google is 'assisting' in making this trend popular in Android phones,,"If you take a look at more than handful smartphones launched so far in 2019, they all seem to have one thing i... Read More

Let’s be clear on one thing that just with its Pixel devices, Google would’ve never been able to compete with Apple’s voice assistant Siri. So how does Google make its own voice assistant – Google Assistant – more popular? Simple: piggyback ride on the backs of other smartphone makers. If you take a look at more than handful smartphones launched so far in 2019, they all seem to have one thing in common: a dedicated button for Google Assistant.

In fact, at the Mobile World Congress 2019 , Nokia’s two smartphones – Nokia 3.2 and Nokia 4.2 – both have dedicated buttons for Google Assistant. It has also been spotted on two LG smartphones as well. However, LG had a dedicated Google Assistant button last year as well in its G7 and V40 smartphones. This year’s LG devices – the G8 ThinQ – also have the same button.

That’s not all. According to a report by 9to5Google, Xiaomi ’s Mi Mix 3 5G and Mi 9 are also expected to have a separate button for the Google Assistant. The report also suggests that Google is looking to reach over 100 million devices with its dedicated Google Assistant button. Even in the Vivo V15 Pro, we have seen the same button.

Meanwhile it’s been a busy day at the Mobile World Congress. Huawei showcased the world’s first 5G foldable phone whereas Nokia has been busy launching as many as five new devices. These five new devices include the Nokia 9 PureView (world’s first phone to feature 5 rear cameras), Nokia 1 Plus, Nokia 4.2 and Nokia 3.2. As we mentioned earlier, the budget smartphones from Nokia – 3.2 and 4.2 – feature the Google Assistant button. It’s clear that one of the most common trend of 2019 will be a separate button to fire the Google Assistant. Let’s see if other smartphone makers also follow suit in making Google reach its ambitious 100 million device mark.

Apple iOS: Apple continues to be way ahead of Google in this numbers game,,"When it comes to the latest OS update on its devices, Apple beats Google handsomely

When it comes to market share in the smartphone market, Apple ’s fortunes might be fluctuating but it still stays miles ahead of competition when it comes to one particular thing: adoption of the latest version of its operating system. So much so that now 4 out 5 iOS devices have the latest version (iOS 12). According to the numbers released on Apple’s Developer webpage, “as measured by the App Store on February 24, 2019, 80% of all devices are using iOS 12.”

Compare this to adoption of Google’s latest Android variant and Apple’s rival’s numbers are embarrassingly low. While the latest Android adoption numbers haven’t been made public by Google, a couple of months back when iOS was at 60%, Android Pie had mere 0.1% of adoption rate. The numbers must have grown at the turn of the year but since Google hasn’t released them we can’t be sure of the exact figure. What we can be sure of is that it won’t be anywhere close to the numbers Apple just posted.

Apple’s iOS 12, on the other hand, has seen its numbers grow handsomely in the last few months. In December 2018, iOS 12 adoption was 70% which grew to 75% in January and it’s now at 80%. Even when compared to last year’s OS update (iOS 11), iOS 12 seems to be clocking better adoption numbers. In January 2018, iOS 11 was adopted by 65% Apple users which is comparatively less than iOS 12.

Speaking of OS versions, it is expected that both Apple and Google will give a glimpse into their next versions sometime in May and June. Google is set to hold its I/O 2019 developer conference in May and has already confirmed dates. Apple, on the other hand, will hold its annual WWDC conference in June. The dates for those are yet to be confirmed by the Cupertino-based tech behemoth.

Coronavirus outbreak: Myth and facts,,"READ ALSO:

Cold weather and snow kill the new coronavirus



There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.



Taking a hot bath prevent the new coronavirus disease



Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that coud occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.



The new coronavirus can be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting COVID-19 cases.



Even though the new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days (depending on the type of surface), it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. If you think a surface may be contaminated, use a disinfectant to clean it. After touching it, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.



The new coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites



To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.



Hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus



Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.



Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?



UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.



How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?



Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.



Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?



No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?



At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans.



Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?



No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.



Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?



No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold . However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.



Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?



Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.



Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?



People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?



No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.



Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?



To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

While the last million cases came in 18 days, it took just 13 to reach from six million to seven million. This denotes that the spread of the virus has clearly slowed down.After recording deaths below 500 for two consecutive days, India recorded 509 fatalities on Tuesday, taking the cumulative toll to 1,20,005. However, barring Sunday and Monday — when 489 and 490 deaths were recorded, respectively — Tuesday’s toll was the lowest since the July 12 tally of 492.Active cases continued to slide and stood at 6,14,197.Fresh cases in Maharashtra rose by 5,363 after a dip on Monday when new less than 4,000 new infections were recorded.

Covid-19 to erode 3 years of fiscal consolidation gains of states: RBI,,"MUMBAI: The additional outgo to combat the impact of COVID-19 will significantly erode the fiscal consolidation achieved by the state governments in the past three years, an RBI report said on Tuesday.In its study of the state budgets of 2020-21, the RBI report which has dwelled on the theme 'COVID-19 and its Spatial Dimensions in India', said that Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD) of the states would spiral during the current fiscal.""States have budgeted their consolidated GFD at 2.8 per cent of GDP in 2020-21; however, the COVID-19 pandemic may alter budget estimates significantly, eroding the gains of consolidation secured in the preceding three years - the average GFD for states that presented their budgets before the outbreak of COVID-19 is 2.4 per cent of GSDP, while the average for budgets presented post-lockdown is 4.6 per cent,"" the report said.Observing that the quality of spending and the credibility of state budgets will assume critical importance, it said, ""the next few years are going to be challenging for the states. They have played an important role in the frontline of the defence against the pandemic.Going forward, they need to remain empowered to provide growth impulses to the Indian economy and build resilience against future pandemics as well.Sustaining the recovery from the pandemic will reshape state finances, entailing boosting investment in health care systems and other social safety nets in line with the states' demographic and co-morbidity profiles, it added.""They need to remain empowered with effective strategies to drive through these difficult times. Sub-national fiscal policy has to be judicious and calibrated,"" the report said.Across states, maintaining overall stability, quality of spending and credibility of budgets may distinguish one state's resilience from another.The states, the report said, will need to focus on building digital infrastructure to improve provision of public services more efficiently in a post-pandemic new normal and upgrading the urban infrastructure with increased engagement of local governments so as to improve the resilience of our COVID-scarred cities, which were severely hit during the pandemic.The study noted that the Indian economy has been hit hard, with the second largest caseload in the world and the COVID-19 curve yet to flatten on a sustained basis.With about a quarter of GDP already lost in Q1: 2020-21 (April-March) and the contraction estimated at close to 10 per cent in Q2, ""public finances have been subjected to severe strains"".""The debilitating combination of compression in tax receipts and ramped-up expenditures has generated unprecedented pressures on fiscal positions at sub-national levels,"" it said.Some states have been impacted quicker and harder than others, depending upon indigenous demographics and epidemiological features as well as availability and accessibility of health care resources, said the RBI's study.Supply chain disruptions have also been different depending on nature of businesses and other activities that various states specialise.Further, with health care, social services and other critical aspects of containment being the responsibilities of state governments, testing, monitoring, and enforcing confinement and ensuring the continuity of provision of essential services has turned out to be a function of the digitisation base of states.As against the conventional push/ pull factors which work towards influencing the migrants' movement, a different kind of push/pull worked during the pandemic, associated with high levels of informal unemployment.""Indian states had to contend with reverse migration from abroad as well as across states, with large-scale implications for underlying activity, conditional upon the extent of dependence of states on migrants for factor income, employment and performance of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs),"" it said, and added this had implications for state finances as well.As per the RBI, the overall impact on state finances would be conditional upon the exposure to COVID-19, the availability of initial fiscal space and access to rainy day funds, or other reserve funds, if any.State governments' responses by delaying or cutting down expenditures, even wages and salaries, also need to be taken into account in the assessment of the pandemic's direct effects on state finances."

The third peak has come in the US, Paul said, adding that ""becoming a bit lax..slowing down surveillance, containment strategies also must be playing a role"".He said that Kerala, West Bengal and Delhi are proceeding towards a third peak.This is a matter of concern and there can be no complacency in following Covid-19 ""appropriate behaviour"" in the coming times as more challenges will emerge, Paul said.More festivals are coming and ""where ever we have faltered in the last few days, it will show in 10 to 12 days"", he said.Secretary in the health ministry, Rajesh Bhushan , said that it has been observed that states and union territories like Kerala, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi have reported rise in cases during the festival season.""It is mandatory for all of us to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the festival season,"" he said.Continuous decline in average daily new coronavirus cases has been observed and the figure has come down from 83,232 between September 23-29 to 49,909 for October 21-27, Bhushan said.""India's Covid-19 case fatality rate has declined from 1.77 per cent on September 1 to 1.50 per cent as on date.

NEW DELHI: Cadila Healthcare Ltd, one of two Indian drugmakers racing to develop an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, is in talks with potential partners to ramp up production capacity if its candidate passes human clinical trials The Ahmedabad-based firm is looking to hire contract manufacturers for an additional 50 million to 70 million doses of its plasmid DNA vaccine, on top of the 100 million that will come from its own capacity, according to managing director Sharvil Patel. He declined to name the companies and the amount Cadila has invested in developing the vaccine.“We’re just waiting for phase II to push that part of the process,” Patel, the 42-year-old, third-generation head of family-owned Cadila, said in a phone interview. “We have a lot of interest from people who want to use it for other countries and we will license it out for other markets and countries so we can have more manufacturing beyond India.”Obtaining and delivering a safe vaccine is a major priority for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a nation with the world’s largest number of infections after the US. While a government-backed scientific panel last week predicted that the South Asian country is past the peak of infections and may contain the spread by February, many are concerned of further spikes as a festival season commences ahead of densely populated north India’s cold and polluted winter.Cadila, which also produces coronavirus treatments such as remdesivir, is among a number of Indian companies holding vaccine trials.While Cadila’s plasmid DNA candidate doesn’t use an infectious agent, like other vaccines, and instead introduces the DNA sequence encoding the antigen, the other tests being done are for traditional delivery methods.The Serum Institute of India Pvt, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, is conducting tests for the candidate developed by Oxford University. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd plans to distribute the Russian vaccine in India after conducting final-stage human trials and receiving regulatory approval.Both Cadila and Bharat Biotech International Ltd, the other Indian drugmaker developing its own indigenous vaccine, are currently conducting second-phase human trial stages. By the end of November, Patel expects to see data from the tests that have enrolled more than 1,000 people.If the results are promising, Cadila will begin recruitment in December of more than 30,000 people for final-stage trials. Patel said that process will likely take two to three months and that he doesn’t expect many delays from Indian regulators.“The regulators themselves are working faster, which is a good thing,” Patel said.The government has also set aside about Rs 50,000 crore ($7 billion) to vaccinate the world’s second-most populous country, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Adar Poonawalla, the head of the Serum Institute, has predicted India would need about Rs 80,000 crore to procure and inoculate people across the South Asian nation. Apart from buying the treatment, industry executives and experts have also voiced concern over India’s ability to store and transport vaccines across the vast country of about 1.3 billion people.Patel declined to comment on whether he thought Rs 50,000 crore would suffice, but said he wasn’t worried about potential delivery and cold-chain storage bottlenecks given that vaccine supply will initially be restricted to priority areas and those at high risk.“It should be manageable,” he said, noting that Cadila’s shots will have low cold-chain storage requirements making them easier to transport. “It’s going to be a couple of years process,” Patel said. “Once it becomes open markets, then we have to see whether it can reach every nook and cranny of every part of the country.”"
Covid vaccine will be free for all: Minister,,"BHUBANESWAR: Everyone in the country will get Covid-19 vaccine free of cost, Union minister of state for animal husbandry and MSME Pratap Sarangi said in Balasore on Monday.

Meanwhile, in Bhubaneshwar , Odisha health minister Naba Kishore Das said the state government is committed to universal vaccination for Covid-19 for all people in the state.

The central government formed expert committee headed by Dr VK Paul, early this month expressed apprehensions that the festival related gatherings, winter months which make respiratory illnesses severer, and patients coming from outside Delhi could lead to sudden rise in Covid-19 cases.After the successful containment of the first surge in June, the city witnessed a second surge in September when nearly 4.500 single-day positive cases were reported on September 16 and slowly the daily Covid tally started marginally declining. Though it largely remained between 2000 to 3000 positive cases a day. It breached the 4000 mark on Friday and remained above 4,000 for all days except Monday when the total number of tests were only 34411.The number of deaths witnessed on Tuesday is lower than a day earlier when the city reported 54 deaths.

Covid-19: HC asks Delhi govt to ensure sero survey report not leaked to media,,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court Tuesday directed the AAP government to ensure that the report of the fourth sero surveillance, which is likely to conclude soon, shall not be leaked to the media till the matter is heard by it. The high court also expressed displeasure over delay in informing persons about their result of Covid-19 test , which should be conveyed in 24 hours.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad noted that one of the court staff got his test report after four days and said such things should not happen.The high court was informed by Delhi government counsel Satyakam that the fourth sero surveillance will conclude on October 22 and the report would come out after a fortnight.The counsel said one of their senior professors who will analyse the sero survey reports is suffering from Covid-19.The bench directed that the sero survey report be not leaked to the media before the next date of hearing on November 11.It also sought the stand of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on a new test called Feluda, which is being marketed by TATA sons and is pending approval from ICMR.The high court was hearing a PIL by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking increasing the Covid-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.The high court had earlier observed that the AAP government was ""frittering away"" a part of its RT-PCR testing whose numbers were ""abysmally low"" when compared to the rapid testing figures and had said it made no sense when the daily number of coronavirus positive cases were averaging around 3,500-4,000.RT/PCR, short for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a laboratory technique widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and to measure gene expression in research.The government had told the bench that the third of sero surveillance carried out by it in Delhi between September 1 to September 7 has found that seroprevalence of antibodies to Covid-19 in citizens of the national capital has reduced from nearly 29 per cent in August to 25 per cent in September.The bench on September 16, had asked the Delhi government to increase the RT-PCR test capacity to the maximum possible to detect Covid-19 infection, as RATs were only 60 per cent accurate."

Besides, pollution is an added factor,"" Medical Director, LNJP Hospital, Suresh Kumar, told .People with asthma, COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) and other respiratory ailments are more susceptible to suffer fall in their oxygen concentration level and thus more prone to contract the infection from someone else, symptomatic or asymptomatic, he said.According to doctors, respiratory illnesses like viral influenza increase with a spike in pollution levels as poor air quality leads to inflammation in the lungs making it more vulnerable for the virus to penetrate.""We would advise patients with respiratory illnesses to stay indoors as much as possible. Also, appeal to youth to not assume everything is normal again just because the economy is getting eased. Mask should be worn all the time while being outdoor and social distancing norms should be followed,"" said a senior doctor of a government hospital.On September 21, the number of home isolation cases had increased to 19,213 after steady ascent in its count since the last week of August.However, it fell by a margin of 749 on September 22 to 18,464, registering a significant fall after a long time.It fell further down to 17,834 the next day when the number of containment zones stood at 1,987.The containment zone count had crossed the 2,000-mark on September 24 (2,059) and the home isolation cases too had showed a marginal rise (17,995). On September 25 also it slightly rose to 18,096.However, the cases of home isolation fell gradually for five consecutive days from September 26-30.The Delhi government had been laying a lot of emphasis on home isolation, especially for asymptomatic patients, as part of its Covid-19 management strategy in the past several months.Recently, it was decided to not stick cautionary posters on the walls of houses of patients who are under home isolation."

"Coronavirus in Karnataka: Govt has spent Rs 42,00 crore on fight against Covid-19, says minister",,"A view of Karnataka assembly during the monsoon session

BENGALURU: The Karnataka government on Wednesday said it had spent no less than Rs 4,200 crore since March till August on its fight against Covid-19 pandemic.

Responding to a debate on government action in fighting the pandemic and misappropriation in medical equipment purchases at the legislative assembly, medical education minister K Sudhakar said Karnataka is still in the midst of the “war against Covid” and that there is a long way to go for achieving victory against the virus.

“While the opposition claims there is a Rs 2,300 crore misappropriation, I would like to place it on record that the total expenditure in this fight itself is Rs 4,200 crore. The amount has been spent by 15 departments of the state in their various capacities,” he said.

The minister said the maximum amount of expenditure has been used by the health and family welfare department with Rs 1,142 crore while his department, medical education, has spent Rs 76 crore till date.

The other big department expenditure is from the labour welfare board which has spent Rs 824 crore in direct benefit transfer (DBT) to 16.48 lakh.

Reiterating the government's stand that there was no misappropriation, Sudhakar claimed that there were four scrutiny committees which looked into every purchase of medical equipment, including the personal protection equipment (PPE) and ventilators.

“In the last six months we have tried to upgrade the medical health facilities and that is the reason we have spent on high quality products,” he said, while claiming the opposition allegations as misleading.

Citing the example of the Rs 18 lakh ventilator which was procured by the government, Sudhakar said only one such equipment was procured at that rate.

“Now, the opposition claims that neighbouring Tamil Nadu has purchased 100 ventilators at Rs 4.8 lakh each. These ventilators are transport or ambulance ventilators and cannot be used in ICUs. The Rs 18 lakh ventilator is of high definition quality and is used in the ICU by us,” he justified.

However, the minister could not respond to questions raised by opposition leader Siddaramaiah that all ventilators had the same functionality.

“As far as I understand, any ventilator, the basic function is to provide an artificial breathing facility for patients who cannot breathe independently. What does it matter whether it is Rs 4 lakh or Rs 18 lakh? Who are these people using the Rs 18 lakh ventilator?” he retorted.

However, the minister and Karnataka government stuck to its stand that there was no misappropriation and refused to commission a judicial probe into it.

Not happy with the response, the Congress and JD(S) legislators walked out of the assembly as a mark of protest.

Earlier, Sudhakar, justifying the reasons for the sudden spike of Covid-19 positive cases in the state over the last two months, claimed it was primarily due to the influx of people from outside the state.

“Every state in the country or in other nations have seen a spike of cases for two or three months on account of a sudden rush of migrants back home. Karnataka has also seen this after thousands of people came back home from mostly high risk states which surround the state,” he claimed.

The minister said after unlock phases began and people returned to normalcy, these numbers started to multiply and add to the spike.

EU warns not enough Covid vaccines for all in Europe until 2022,,"BRUSSELS: Only part of the European Union population can be inoculated against the new coronavirus before 2022, EU officials said in an internal meeting, as the vaccines the bloc is securing may not prove effective or may not be manufactured in sufficient doses.The 27-nation bloc, with a population of 450 million, has booked more than 1 billion doses of potential Covid-19 vaccines from three drugmakers. It is negotiating the advance purchase of another billion vials with other companies.""There will not be sufficient doses of Covid-19 vaccines for the entire population before the end of 2021,"" a European Commission official told diplomats from EU states in a closed-door meeting on Monday, a person who attended it told Reuters A second official confirmed the statement. An EU Commission spokesman was not immediately available for comment.The EU Commission had earlier said vaccines will be limited ""during the initial stages of deployment"" but had never clarified how long the initial phase would last.There is still no effective Covid-19 vaccine, but the first shots could be available at the beginning of next year, the Commission said earlier in October.Given a likely limited supply, the Commission has for months urged EU governments to devise vaccination plans that would prioritise vulnerable and essential groups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly or people with chronic diseases .But apart from a consensus on inoculating doctors and nurses, ""there is no common line on other groups,"" the Commission official said at the internal meeting this week.In July a paper agreed by the Commission and EU governments said at least 40% of the EU population should be vaccinated in the first phase.Some EU countries want to book doses for their entire population with the aim of rolling them out already by mid-2021.A third EU official said this bold goal could be achieved if the EU reached supply deals with at least seven vaccine candidates.The EU has so far secured doses of the potential vaccines being developed by AstraZeneca , Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson. It has also said it is in talks with Moderna, Pfizer and CureVac."
"Wall Street tumbles as virus cases soar, stimulus hopes fade",,"(Representative image: AP)

NEW DELHI: US stocks decline picked pace on Monday afternoon, setting the Dow for its worst day in more than seven weeks, as soaring coronavirus cases and a political deadlock over the fiscal relief bill raised doubts about the fate of the economy recovery.

New infections have touched record levels in the United States, with El Paso in Texas asking citizens to stay at home for the next two weeks. In Europe, Italy and Spain imposed new restrictions.

Travel-related stocks, vulnerable to COVID-19 related curbs, dropped. The S&P 1500 airlines index fell 5% and cruise line operators Carnival Corp and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd shed more than 9.5% each.

""People are nervous about the expansion in cases,"" said Christopher C Grisanti, chief equity strategist, MAI Capital Management, Cleveland, Ohio.

""The administration has said it does not want to slow down the economy yet as cases rise they may not have a choice.""

Energy index tracked a more than 3% fall in oil prices. Other economically-sensitive industrials and financials sectors posted the steepest percentage declines among S&P sectors.

Meanwhile, chances of a fiscal stimulus before the presidential election faded as US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said there were a number of areas in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's plan that President Donald Trump cannot accept.

Wall Street's fear gauge hit a near seven-week high even as 60 million Americans voted in a record breaking early turnout as Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden enter their final week of campaigning.

It is also one of the busiest weeks of the third-quarter earnings season that will see results from mega-cap US tech firms including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc.

The tech sector, which includes Apple, is among the only three sectors apart from healthcare and consumer staples that is expected to post an increase in profit compared to a year earlier.

Of the 139 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, 83.5% of them have beaten Wall Street expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

At 12:30 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 767.14 points or 2.68% to 27,577.43, the S&P 500 lost 73.59 points or 2.11% to 3,392.13 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 201.99 points, or 1.75% to 11,347.51.

Software company Oracle Corp fell about 4% after German rival SAP abandoned medium-term profitability targets and warned of a longer than expected recovery time from the pandemic hit.

Hasbro Inc tumbled 10% as quarterly adjusted revenue fell due to coronavirus-led delays in the production of movies and TV shows.

Companies deemed stay-at-home winners including Amazon.com Inc, Zoom Video Communications Inc and video game companies Activision Blizzard Inc and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc rose between 2.2% and 0.3%.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 7.91-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 5.00-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded three new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 38 new lows.

Melbourne Lockdown News: Melbourne lockdown lifted after zero new virus cases recorded,,"MELBOURNE: Australia's second-biggest city will this week exit its coronavirus lockdown following nearly four months under onerous restrictions, authorities announced Monday, after no new daily cases or deaths were recorded.Stay-at-home orders for Melbourne's five million residents will be lifted from midnight Tuesday into Wednesday while restaurants, beauty salons and retail stores will be permitted to throw open their doors.Melbourne and the surrounding Victoria state recorded the first 24-hour period without any new Covid-19 cases since June 8 -- before security bungles at quarantine hotels housing returned international travellers sparked a major outbreak in July.Announcing the much-anticipated relaxing of restrictions, Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews ' voice cracked as he declared it an "" emotional day "".""This has been a very difficult year. And Victorians have given a lot and I'm proud of every single one of them,"" he told reporters in Melbourne.Asked if ale-loving Victorians could now ""get on the beers"", Andrews said he ""might go a little higher up the shelf"".Jubilant social media users declared the return to zero cases and deaths ""Donut Day"", with the hashtag trending as Twitter users posted selfies with the sweet treats in celebration.Melbourne in the summer became the epicentre of the country's second coronavirus wave, with new daily cases rising above 700 in August when the rest of Australia was already rolling back restrictions.Some curbs were already lifted last week, allowing haircuts and golf games to return, but further easing planned for Sunday was delayed by 24 hours to assess thousands of test results after a small outbreak in the city's north.Andrews said all the tests had returned negative.""It was worth waiting to be absolutely confident to be sure that our team had their arms around those positive cases and fundamental control of the outbreak -- and that is exactly what these numbers show us,"" he said.Pressure had been mounting for weeks on state authorities to allow the city more freedoms, with a litany of rules remaining in place as they took a cautious approach to reopening despite the falling number of cases.The rest of Victoria state is already enjoying fewer restrictions, with gyms set to reopen and outdoor live music to resume from Tuesday.Restrictions on travel between Melbourne and regional Victoria will be lifted from November 8, with a 25-kilometre (15-mile) travel radius for city residents also set to be removed the same day.The state remains cut off from the rest of Australia, where regional authorities have largely taken a hyper-vigilant response to Covid-19 such as maintaining internal border restrictions.Those measures have attracted criticism from some quarters.On Sunday, conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison took a partisan swipe at Andrews' centre-left government, claiming Victoria's restrictions had caused ""1,000 job losses per day"".Overall, Australia has been relatively successful in containing the spread of the coronavirus, with about 27,500 cases and 905 deaths in a population of 25 million.The country also maintains strict controls on its international borders to prevent transmission of the virus from overseas, which has left tens of thousands of its own citizens stranded abroad.Authorities now hope to remove internal travel restrictions, bring more Australians home from overseas, and create ""travel bubbles"" with other countries that have curbed the virus -- all while continuing to maintain low case numbers."
Oxford Covid 19 Vaccine: UK hospital told to prepare for Oxford Covid vaccine in November; Report,,"More on Covid-19

'Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trials produce robust immune response in elderly'

LONDON: Staff at a major London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc , The Sun newspaper reported on Monday.The Sun said the hospital was told to prepare for the vaccine from the ""week commencing the 2 November.""A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, hammered the global economy and shuttered normal life across the world.The Oxford vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate.Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine was developed by Oxford University scientists and licensed to AstraZeneca in April, which took on the task of scaling trials and production.The British drugmaker has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial.The vaccine is likely to provide protection for about a year, CEO Pascal Soriot said in June.The Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc produces a robust immune response in elderly people, the Financial Times said on Monday, citing early results.The Oxford vaccine triggers protective antibodies and T-cells in older age groups, the FT said, citing two people familiar with the finding.Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the newspaper reported.Oxford and AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, the FT said. It did not name the publication.The FT cautioned that positive immunogenicity tests do not guarantee the vaccine will ultimately prove safe and effective in older people."
Coronavirus vaccine news: Vaccine hopes rise as Oxford jab prompts immune response among old as well as young adults,,"Common cold virus

LONDON: One of the world's leading Covid-19 experimental vaccines produces a immune response in both young and old adults, raising hopes of a path out of the gloom and economic destruction wrought by the novel coronavirus The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc , which is helping manufacture the vaccine, said on Monday.A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.""It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the Covid-19 disease severity is higher,"" an AstraZeneca spokesman said.""The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,"" the spokesman said, referring to the technical name of the vaccine.The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate, as the world tries to plot a path out of the Covid-19 pandemic.The news that older people get an immune response from the vaccine is positive because the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus.If it works, a vaccine would allow the world to return to some measure of normality after the tumult of the pandemic.British health secretary Matt Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready but he was preparing logistics for a possible roll out mostly in the first half of 2021.Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year he told the BBC: ""I don't rule that out but that is not my central expectation.""""The programme is progressing well, (but) we're not there yet,"" Hancock said.Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the Financial Times reported earlier.Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, the FT said.

The scale and speed of the testing is in line with those seen during other outbreaks including the most recent one in Qingdao earlier this month.Though the number of new Covid-19 cases are down sharply in mainland China from the peaks seen in February, Beijing is wary of another wave of infections and maintains mass and rapid testing capabilities.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China to date now stands at 85,810, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634."

Dinner off as Italy closes restaurants early in virus crackdown,,"AP photo.

ROME: Italy 's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte tightened nationwide coronavirus restrictions Sunday after the country registered a record number of new cases, despite opposition from regional heads and street protests.

Cinemas, theatres, gyms and swimming pools must all close under the new rules, which come into force on Monday and run until November 24. Restaurants and bars will stop serving at 6:00 pm, Conte's office said.

Italy, which was the first European country to be hit hard by the pandemic and impose a nationwide lockdown , on Saturday registered nearly 20,000 new cases over 24 hours.

""The aim is clear: to keep the contagion curve under control, because that is the only way can we manage the pandemic without being overwhelmed by it,"" Conte told a press conference.

It was imperative Italy act now to avoid a second full lockdown, which ""the country can no longer afford"", he said.

Schools and nurseries will remain open, although up to 75 percent of classes for high-schools and universities will move online. People have been urged to avoid using public transport or moving beyond their own communities.

""This is going to destroy us,"" Augusto D'Alfonsi, who owns the Torricella family-run fish restaurant in Rome , told AFP.

""We've already lost 50 percent of our customers this year. Without government aid, we're done for.""

The new measures were introduced just hours after dozens of far-right protesters in Rome clashed with riot police during a demonstration against the region's curfew, setting off fireworks, burning bins and throwing projectiles.

Some 200 masked militants belonging to the neo-fascist group Forza Nuova lead the skirmish in a second night of street protests, after hundreds of demonstrators clashed with officers in Naples further south over the curfew there.

Several regions have imposed overnight curfews in a bid to slow-rising Covid-19 infection numbers. Piedmont in the north and Sicily in the south will follow this week.

But regional leaders had warned that closing businesses would exacerbate social tensions as the country struggles to emerge from its worst post-war recession, sparked by the two-month shudown earlier this year.

Giuseppe Spadafora, deputy president of business lobby Unimpresa, said the ""anger could explode in the coming days and weeks, becoming difficult to control"".

Conte, however, has been under intense pressure from scientists to do more to curb contagion.

""It is a complex moment, there's a lot of tiredness in the country,"" he acknowleged Sunday.

""The pandemic is severly challenging us, it provokes anger, frustration. It's also create new inequalities, on top of the existing ones,"" he said.

Conte said he too ""would feel angry over government measures"" as an ordinary citizen, though ""I would wait to see the economic support, which will be substantial"".

He also warned against ""giving room to those who specialise in protests and social disorder"", after the far-right demonstration in Rome and reports the Naples protest was orchestrated by organised crime.

The World Health Organization's Italian government adviser Walter Ricciardi told the Messaggero daily the country was ""paying the consequences"" of regional governments failing to prepare for a second wave.

""We only have a few weeks to intervene. We need local, even regional lockdowns. The curfew does not work"".

Italy has now registered over 500,000 cases and more than 37,000 deaths, according to health ministry figures.

Over 100 scientists urged the government to act this week after physicist Giorgio Parisi said that without new measures there would be 500 covid deaths a day in Italy by November, at the speed the virus is spreading.

""In March we were about to be hit by a lorry going 130 kilometres an hour. Today it's travelling towards us at 60 kilometres an hour,"" he told the Repubblica newspaper on Saturday.

""We have time to dodge it but if we don't, even if it's travelling more slowly, it will kill us all the same"".

The WHO has said that spraying disinfectants on the streets to fight the novel coronavirus disease could be harmful as it does not eliminate the virus. The health body has warned that spraying disinfectants outdoors even poses a health risk. Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces, such as streets or marketplaces, is not recommended to kill the Covid-19 virus or other pathogens because disinfectant is inactivated by dirt and debris, the WHO has warned. It says that the chemical spraying is also unlikely to cover all surfaces for the duration of required contact time needed to inactivate pathogens. WHO has also said that spraying individuals with disinfectants is not recommended under any circumstances"

"Donald Trump: I am immune to Covid-19, says Trump",,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday declared himself immune from Covid-19 as he prepares to return to the campaign trail in a fight to regain ground against surging White House rival Joe Biden.""It looks like I'm immune for, I don't know, maybe a long time and maybe a short time, it could be a lifetime, nobody really knows, but I'm immune,"" Trump said in a Fox News interview, a day after his doctor affirmed he wasno longer a transmission risk for the disease.""You have a president who is immune... so now you have a president who doesn't have to hide in a basement like his opponent,"" he added -- in a jab at the Democrat Biden and his far more cautious approach to campaigning in a pandemic.It is not yet clear to what degree contracting Covid-19 confers immunity from future infection, with early studies suggesting a few months while newer ones have indicated it could last longer.While it acknowledges that -- generally -- a person who recovers from a viral infection is protected against new infection, the World Health Organization cautioned in August: ""For COVID-19, we do not yet have enough data to confirm if antibodies protect, what antibody levels are required, or how long protection will last.""During his phone interview on Fox News, Trump went on to suggest that his White House rival could himself be sick.""If you look at Joe, he was coughing yesterday horribly and grabbing his mask, as he's coughing,"" Trump said. ""And I don't know what that was all about, and it didn't get much press.""The Biden campaign has been publishing daily coronavirus tests for their candidate since Trump tested positive on October 1 -- landing him in hospital for three nights and derailing his campaign.There has been less transparency surrounding Trump's own state of health, with his medical team repeatedly refusing to say when he lasted tested negative for the virus. That has fueled suspicions that he may not have been tested for several days prior to his diagnosis.Trump rallied hundreds of supporters for a comeback event at the White House on Saturday, and is planning back-to-back rallies this week in a bit to salvage his struggling campaign three weeks from the November 3 election."
India's first coronavirus vaccine: Here is everything we know about its development,,"The whole world is waiting eagerly for an effective vaccine to fight the coronavirus pandemic. It has not only claimed lives, but also impacted people, both physically and mentally. There are more than 170 vaccines in progress right now, but closer home we have our hopes pinned on India’s first vaccine called Covaxin.Under normal circumstances, researchers and scientists take years before formulating and releasing a vaccine, however, the global impact of COVID on humankind has pressed a ‘forward’ button on all vaccines, where it is safe to expect a vaccine in the next 4-5 months (within a span of 12-18 months).Covaxin, the vaccine candidate developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is in Phase 2 clinical trial in the country. And now the makers have sought approval from drug regulators to start the third phase clinical trial. As per reports, the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) has asked Bharat Biotech to submit ""complete safety and immunogenicity data of the phase II trial"" and some clarifications before proceeding for the next stage.The results of their animal-based trial of the vaccine were found to be favourable. ""The vaccine candidate was found to generate robust immune responses. Thus, preventing infection and disease in the primates upon high amounts of exposure to live SARS-CoV-2 virus.""The vaccine candidate has been tested in 12 hospitals across India, where volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 participated in the trial. These volunteers had no co-morbidities. The places where the trial took place include Hyderabad, Delhi, Goa, Rohtak, Patna, Kancheepuram and Bhubaneswar, among other places.Covaxin falls under the category of inactivated vaccines. For the unversed, this means that the virus pathogen is ‘deactivated’ to disable it from causing infection, however, some parts of the virus can be identified by the immune system, leading to an immune reaction.Bharat Biotech took a strain of isolated coronavirus from the National Institute of Virology, Pune to develop the inactivated vaccine at its Hyderabad facility, Genome Valley.The previous week, the firm shared that Covaxin will make use of ViroVax’s adjuvant Alhydroxiquim-II to boost immune response in the body and provide longer lasting immunity. ""There is critical need for development and availability of adjuvants that elucidate mechanisms of action inducing greater antibody responses to vaccine antigens, thus resulting in long-term protection against pathogens. Adjuvants also enhance the sustainability of the global vaccine supply on account of their antigen-sparing effect,"" shared Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech.As per official statement from Bharat Biotech, once the vaccine is injected into a human, it has no potential to infect or replicate, since it is a killed virus. It just serves the immune system as a dead virus and mounts an antibody response towards the virus.To kickstart the phase 3 trial, Bharat Biotech will be enrolling 28,500 volunteers who will be older than 18 years. The trial will be carried out in 10 Indian states including Mumbai, Delhi, Patna and Lucknow.As per reports from PTI, a dose of 0.5 ml on day 0 and 28 will be the administered dose for volunteers.Once the trials are done, Bharat Biotech will be targeting a manufacturing capacity of 300 million doses.India is the largest vaccine producing country in the world and if India is able to produce an indigenous vaccine, it will help in fighting the capacity and managing the delivery capacity.ICMR has said that the vaccine candidate will follow all global norms to produce the most effective vaccine, which may take sometime."

"Excessive use of hand sanitisers may boost antimicrobial resistance, warns experts",,"NEW DELHI: Increased usage of antibiotics during Covid-19 can lead to more antimicrobial resistance, health experts of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences said, adding that the widespread use of hand-sanitisers and antimicrobial soaps can further worsen the situation.Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of a pathogenic microbe to develop a resistance to the effects of an antimicrobial medication. It has been estimated that by 2050, about 10 million human lives could be at risk every year if drug resistance is not managed.Various aspects of antimicrobial resistance were discussed in a two-day international webinar on antibiotic resistance jointly organised by All India Institute of Medical Sciences and American Society for Microbiology.The webinar was organised by Dr Rama Chaudhry, Professor and Head of AIIMS 's Department of Microbiology, International Ambassador of American Society for Microbiology to India and her team Dr Bimal Kumar Das, Dr Sarita Mohapatra, Dr Gagandeep Singh, Dr Hitender Gautam and Dr Nishant Verma.In the webinar, the health experts talked about how the Covid-19 pandemic has jolted the entire world and significantly impacted the focus of health facilities towards antimicrobial resistance.""It has been estimated that as we reach the year 2050, about 10 million human lives could be at risk every year if we do not manage the increasing drug resistance. The widespread use of hand sanitisers and antimicrobial soaps which has especially increased multifold during the Covid-19 pandemic can worsen the situation,"" the experts said.They went on to say that antibiotic-resistant organisms have become rigidly established in our environment with many infections failing to respond to currently available antimicrobials. The antimicrobial resistance has outpaced the development of newer antimicrobials.The health experts added that there is an urgent need to explore the alternative therapies. ""The importance of these non-conventional and alternative therapeutic approaches like bacteriophages, endolysins, nanoparticles, probiotics and antimicrobial peptides are needed.""Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine. It mounts problems beyond the geographical as well as species barriers and can transmit from animals to humans.The webinar was inaugurated by the Guest of Honour and AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria, and Chief Guest Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, Director of National Centre for Disease Control. It also covered a vast range of topics from esteemed speakers from Centre for Disease Control, World Health Organisation Indian Council of Medical Research , PGIMER Chandigarh, and IIT Roorkee.Various aspects of antimicrobial resistance were discussed including surveillance, one health approach, role of whole genome sequencing, including alternative therapies.

"Kerala 4th state to record over 10,000 Covid cases in a day",,"Kerala became the fourth state in the country after Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka to record over 10,000 Covid-19 cases in a day even as the countrywide daily tally, in keeping with the trend of the infection slowing down, remained below the 80,000-mark for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday.

Kerala as well as Karnataka recorded their highest peak in daily cases even as the number of infections in all other states, barring Bengal, was lower than their respective peaks. Kerala recorded 10,606 fresh cases, a huge jump of over 1,300 cases from the previous peak on October 2 when 9,258 patients had tested positive.

Kerala ranks third in the country in active cases — 92,246 — after Maharashtra and Karnataka. Karnataka was close to the 11,000 mark with 10,947 infections on Wednesday, a jump by nearly 500 cases from the previous peak of 10,453 on September 29.

This is for the fourth time in the last nine days that Karnataka has crossed 10,000 infections. However, even as the two southern states see a surge, the trend of the infection slowing down in the country, at least for the time being, continues with active cases nationally dropping for the sixth consecutive day. The active cases on Wednesday stood at 9,10,851, a drop of nearly 45,000 infections from the previous peak of 9,55,400 on October 1.

As per the data collated from states, 78,912 patients tested positive for the virus on Wednesday, higher than the previous day’s figure of 72,552, but much lower than the country’s peak in daily cases since the onset of the pandemic, which was recorded on September 17 at 98,795.

For the fifth straight day, India recorded less than 1,000 fatalities as 974 deaths on Wednesday took the cumulative toll to 1,05,490. The total caseload of the country stands at 68,32,963 while 58,16,622 people have recovered from the virus. Apart from Kerala and Karnataka, Bengal recorded its highest daily peak with 3,455 cases.

India sees 88 rape cases a day; conviction rate below 30%,,"Shocking numbers

Uttar Pradesh holds the worst record

Rajasthan tops in rape cases

No effect of Nirbhaya judgment

NEW DELHI: On September 14 this year, a 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly gangraped in Uttar Pradesh ’s Hathras by four upper-caste men. The incident caused widespread outrage and brought the focus on just how pervasive sexual violence against women is in our country. The woman sustained several injuries and died nearly 14 days later. To make matters worse, the police cremated her in the dead of night without the knowledge and consent of the family.The Supreme Court termed the incident ‘horrible and shocking’ while hearing a plea for probe by the CBI and SIT into the alleged gangrape on Tuesday.However, this isn’t the lone incident that has shaken up the country. Several incidences like Nirbhaya rape case (2012), Unnao rape case (2017), Kathaua rape case (2018) and the Hyderabad rape cum murder case (2019) expose the grim reality of bestial sexual crimes against women in the country. A survey by Thomas Reuters Foundation in 2018 ranked India as the most dangerous country for women.Crimes against women have been steadily rising over the years. According to the latest NCRB report, 2019 saw over 4 lakh reported cases of crimes committed against women, up from 3.78 lakh in 2018 and 3.59 lakh cases in 2017.NCRB reported 32,033 rape cases which translates to a shocking 88 rape cases a day -- and this is just 10% of all crimes against women. Experts say that picture could be far worse as most such crimes go unreported in the country.NCRB data shows that in 2019, Uttar Pradesh topped the states in crimes against women with a whopping 59,853 cases, followed by Rajasthan and Maharashtra with 41,550 and 37,144 cases respectively.In terms of rape incidences, Rajasthan fared worst with nearly 6,000 reported cases. Uttar Pradesh ranked second with over 3,000 cases.The recent incident proves that the execution of the convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case (that took place this year) had no effect on criminals. When the execution took place, it was assumed that it would send a strong message to perpetrators of such crimes, but the recent incidents have proved it otherwise.One reason for this is poor conviction rate and the long road to justice. In 2018 and 2019, the conviction rate for rape was below 30%. Which means out of 100 cases only 30 saw convictions. Absence of forensic labs, fast-track courts and investigators are also partly responsible for this."

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation on Wednesday issued detailed guidelines for refund of fares for flights cancelled during Covid-19 lockdown after the Supreme Court recently decided on the issue. The regulator, based on SC directives, has categorised refund seekers into three categories and issued different directives for them.- Passenger who booked tickets during lockdown for travel during lockdown from 25 March 25,2020, to May 24: If an airline has received payment from such a passenger for either domestic or international travel, it “shall refund the full amount collected without any cancellation charges … within three weeks from the date of cancellation,” the DGCA order says.If tickets have been booked through a travel agent, “full refund shall be given by airlines immediately to the respective travel agent (who in turn) shall immediately pass on (the same) to passengers.”Airlines, both Indian and foreign, will need to refund full fares to category 1 passengers who booked ex-India tickets for international travel.- Passengers who booked tickets any time prior to lockdown for journey up to May 24, 2020, and flight cancelled due Covid-19: “Airlines shall make all endeavours to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days from October 7, 2020. If on account of financial distress, any airline/airlines are not able to do so, they shall provide credit shell, equal to the amount of fare collected, in the name of passenger when the booking is done either directly by the passenger or through travel agent so as to consume (utilise) the same on or before March 31, 2021,… on any route of (their) choice or the passenger can transfer the credit shell to any person including the travel agent through whom he / she has booked the ticket and the airlines shall honour such a transfer,” the order says.The credit shell issued in the name of the passenger shall be transferable and used for travel up to March 31, 2021. “In cases where tickets are booked through agent, credit shell as issued in the name of the passenger which is not utilised by March 31, 2021, refund of the fare collected shall be made to the same account from which account amount was received by the airline,” it adds.Based on SC directives, the DGCA has asked airlines to incentivise all those issued credit shells. “…compensate the passenger from the date of cancellation up to June 30, 2020, in which event the credit shell shall be enhanced by 0.5% of the face value (the amount of fare collected) for every month or part thereof between the date of cancellation and June 30, 2020. Thereafter the value of the credit shell shall be enhanced by 0.75% of the face value per month up to March 31, 2021,” it says.Category 2 passengers who have booked ticket for international travel on a foreign carrier and the booking is ex-India, “then the airline shall make full refund to the passenger”.- Passengers who booked ticket anytime for journey after May, 24, 2020: Normal refund rules as per applicable civil aviation requirements (rules) of DGCA will apply to category 3 passengers whether domestic or ex-India International.“All stakeholders are instructed to ensure strict compliance of the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the above judgement,” says the order issued to all schedule Indian and foreign airlines operating to and from India, by the DGCA on Wednesday."
"CDC revises guidance, says COVID-19 can spread through virus lingering in air",,"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday said COVID-19 can spread through virus lingering in the air, sometimes for hours, acknowledging concerns widely voiced by public health experts about airborne transmission of the virus.The CDC guidance comes weeks after the agency published - and then took down - a similar warning, sparking debate over how the virus spreads.In Monday's guidance, CDC said there was evidence that people with COVID-19 possibly infected others who were more than 6 feet away, within enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.Under such circumstances, CDC said scientists believe the amount of infectious smaller droplet and particles, or aerosols, produced by the people with COVID-19 become concentrated enough to spread the virus.The CDC has long warned of transmission through small droplets that shoot through the air and generally fall to the ground, which resulted in the six-feet social distancing rule. Aerosol droplets are much smaller still, and can remain suspended in the air, like smoke.While CDC stresses close-contact transmission is more common than through air, a group of U.S. scientists warned in an unrelated open letter published in medical journal Science on Monday that aerosols lingering in the air could be a major source of COVID-19 transmission. (https://bit.ly/34pSPbH)""The reality is airborne transmission is the main way that transmission happens at close range with prolonged contact,"" the researchers said in a press call.Viruses in aerosols can remain in the air for seconds to hours, travel more than two meters and accumulate in poorly ventilated indoor air, leading to superspreading events, the researchers said.Since individuals with COVID-19 release thousands of virus-laden aerosols and far fewer droplets while breathing and talking, the scientists said the focus must be on protecting against airborne transmission.They also said that public health officials should clearly differentiate between droplets ejected by coughing or sneezing and aerosols that can carry the virus to greater distancesPublic health officials must highlight the importance of moving activities outdoors and improving indoor air, along with wearing mask and social distancing, the letter said.(Reporting by Vishwadha Chander in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)"

Its test positivity rate (TPR) during the period was also high at 13.8%, much above the national average of 7.3%. Only Maharashtra has a higher TPR in the country -- 16.7%.Health experts said Kerala's Covid peak is expected in two weeks and the key question is whether the state's health infrastructure is ready to handle more patients. The answer is not that encouraging.""There are ICUs and ventilators ready in districts to treat Covid patients but there is no adequate trained manpower. There is excess pressure on the existing facilities due to this. Once we reach our peak, it will be catastrophic and we will see more deaths,"" a health department official said. Incidentally, the expert committee headed by Dr B Ekbal and even the chief secretary has been asking the health department to train doctors and nurses to handle the critical care units but nothing much has moved on the ground.There is also a manpower crisis, with health workers in conflict with the government. ""The recent incidents at Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital , the cancellation of seven days' off for those involved in Covid duty and salary cut with extra duty are definitely demotivating for healthcare workers. We have been working tirelessly and frustration is growing now,"" said Dr Joseph Chacko, president, Kerala Government Medical Officers' Association. ""The Covid infrastructure needs to be strengthened and made accessible to the general public. Silent hypoxia (drop in oxygen levels) is a main problem in Covid and people suddenly feel ill. At that moment, they should know which hospital to go to in their districts,"" said Dr Shenoy Padmanabha who has been analysing the Covid pattern across the country."

Further, Section 126(1)(b) of R P Act prohibits display to the public of any 'election matter' on TV, during period of 48 hours ending with hour fixed for conclusion of poll.As per EC instructions brought to the notice of all registered national parties, ""no matter related to election can be shown or displayed in theatres, TV channels or electronic media during the said period of 48 hours"".The Commission on Wednesday said it had received reports and complaints that some TV channels had displayed interview given by the Congress president where he is talking about Gujarat elections. Terming telecast of interview as “display of election matter” in violation of the 48-hour ban in force for Phase-2 polling, the Election Commission on Wednesday directed the state chief electoral officer to initiate filing of an FIR against the said channels as well as Rahul Gandhi under Section 126(1)(b) of Representation of the People Act (R P Act), 1951.The Commission also asked the TV channels “which are violating the provision of Section 126(1)(b) by displaying said election matter in Phase 2 districts in Gujarat to forthwith stop the display of such matter”."
Subhash Chandra Bose: File that could solve Bose’s death mystery ‘closed for 100 years’,,"CHENNAI: A request made by Paris-based historian JBP More for access to a secret file of the French military authorities, which may unravel the mystery behind the death of Subhas Chandra Bose, was refused by the French national archival authorities recently. They said the file was closed for 100 years.

“After years of research, I can confirm that Bose’s life ended in Saigon, most probably at Vietnam’s Bot Catinat prison, on the basis of the French secret service records,” he said. “The letter of the French authorities not to allow me to consult a lone file pertaining to the INA and Bose in Saigon has come as a great surprise to me. This goes to affirm my conviction that Bose’s life ended in Saigon sometime in September 1945. That is why this file has been classified as out of reach for consultation for 100 years,” said More, who teaches at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Economiques et Commerciales, Paris.

More said it is now up to the concerned people or the Indian authorities to demand the French to open up this lone file that is withheld from the public for 100 years. “This file must contain information about the last days of Bose,” said More.

In July, based on a French secret service report dated December 11, 1947 at the National Archives of France, More had come up with a finding that Bose didn’t die in an air crash .

“It seems quite certain that Bose did not die in the air crash off Taipei as popularly believed. If he had died there, then Bose’s ashes kept in Tokyo needs to undergo DNA test to confirm that it was really Bose who had died in the air crash. Since this test was never done, one could reasonably hold that the ashes did not belong to Bose,” he said.

Besides, other stories had been planted on and off that Bose escaped to Russia or China. According to More, these stories have been floated by vested interests to cover up the fact that Bose was arrested in Saigon after 17th August 1945.

“This has been attested by the French secret service records. So at this juncture, one can assert without hesitation that Bose’s life journey had ended sometime in September 1945 in Saigon/HO Chi Minh city, most probably at Bot Catinat prison or somewhere else in the most tragic way,” he said.

A report filed by French captain Pauwels, who was chief of police in Saigon after August 1945, is crucial in this case. “The arrest of Bose and some of his Saigon associates was made under the orders and supervision of Captain Pauwels and they were incarcerated at Bot Catinat prison, which was the dreaded principal colonial prison,” said More, quoting Note Verbale of Capitaine Pauwels, chief of police services, Saigon dated 26 January 1946.

Read this story in Marathi

NEW DELHI: A controversy broke out on Wednesday over Rahul Gandhi 's visit to Gujarat's famed Somnath temple , after his name was reportedly listed in the register of non-Hindu visitors.Congress party's media coordinator Manoj Tyagi made the alleged goof-up on Wednesday when Rahul Gandhi was paying a visit to the Somnath temple ahead of a two-day campaign tour in the poll-bound state. While writing the name of Congress MP Ahmed Patel, who was also part of Rahul's entourage, in the special register for non-Hindus visiting the temple, Tyagi also jotted down the Congress vice-president's name.A famous pilgrim place of Lord Shiva, the Somnath temple is barred to non-Hindus, who must obtain permission from the temple authorities to enter the sacred place.While Rahul offered prayers at the Somnath temple earlier this afternoon, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was addressing a public rally at Prachi, a town barely 25 kms away from the temple.Taking a swipe at Rahul for his stopover at Somnath temple, PM Modi remarked that his great-grandfather and India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had been opposed to the building of the shrine.""Today some people are remembering Somnath, I have to ask them - Have you forgotten your history? Your family members, our first Prime Minister, was not happy with the idea of abeing built there,"" PM Modi said at a rally in nearby Prachi.The ancient temple was already the cynosure of media attention owing to the high profile campaign rallies scheduled in its vicinity on Wednesday. At such a time, Tyagi's flub was posted on social media, where it went viral. 'Somnath temple' quickly rose to the list of top trends on micro-blogging site Twitter.Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia dismissed the incident as a storm in a teacup and panned the BJP for questioning Rahul's faith over the matter, while also insisting that Rahul Gandhi was unaware of the error.""Rahul Gandhi did puja as a Hindu in Somanth temple. When his media coordinator wrote down Ahmed Patel's name in the special register, temple authorities asked who will be accompanying Ahmedbhai. So he wrote down Rahul ji's name. Rahul ji was not even aware of such an entry in any register,"" Modhwadia told TOI.The Congress party's official Twitter handle later issued a clarification stating that Rahul only signed the temple's visitors book and the other images being circulated were ""fabricated"".""Rahul ji doesn't require the BJP's certificate for his faith. The BJP has been exposed on their so called development claims so now they're trying to divert people's attention by raising such non issues,"" Modhwadia added.The temple administration said Rahul's name was written in the shrine's register for non-Hindus by his media coordinator and maintained none of its staff was involved in the entire episode, reported PTI.Rahul's visit to the Somnath temple is the latest in a long line of temple tours over the last few weeks as part of his Gujarat Navsarjan Yatra . The Gandhi scion has faced fire from the BJP for these pilgrimages, which the saffron party claims are a pre-poll stunt to garner votes.Both the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi are on a campaign blitzkrieg in Gujarat , which goes to polls in two phases on December 9 and 14."
"Air India: Woman passenger, Air India duty manager slap each other at Delhi IGI airport",,"Ahmedabad-bound woman passenger had an argument with Air India official. (Representative image)

NEW DELHI: A woman passenger and an Air India duty manager slapped each other at the Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday morning after she was denied boarding for reporting late, police said.

The incident took place after the Ahmedabad-bound woman passenger had an argument with the official.

""A lady passenger was told by a counter staff that she will not be able to check in because she was late for the flight. This led to an argument and the staff directed her to the duty manager who was also a lady and there was an altercation,"" an Air India spokesperson said.

Sources in the airline said the passenger allegedly slapped the duty manager.

The duty manager also hit back, DCP, Airport, Sanjay Bhatia said.

""Arguments started between the passenger and Air India lady staff and the passenger slapped her. Lady staff in retaliation also slapped her,"" Bhatia said.

The passenger later called the police and went to the police station.

Both the passenger and the Air India staff later apologised to each other and the issue was amicably resolved, the spokesperson added.

India stands with Egypt: PM Modi condemns mosque attack

CAIRO: At least 235 worshippers were killed and 109 others injured when heavily-armed terrorists bombed a mosque and opened fire on people attending Friday prayers in Egypt's restive North Sinai region, in the deadliest terror attack in the country.The terrorists launched a targeted bomb and gun attack on the al-Rowda mosque in Al-Arish city during the Friday prayers, the state-run MENA news agency reported.After the bomb ripped through the mosque, the gunmen on four off-road vehicles opened fire on the worshippers who tried to escape from the site after the explosion, it said.At least 235 worshippers were killed and 109 others injured in the attack, Ahram Online said.Pictures from the scene show rows of bloodied victims inside the mosque.The blasts from improvised explosive devices caused considerable damage to the mosque, the website added.Speaking to state-run Masriya TV station, Egyptian health ministry spokesman Khalid Mujahid described the incident as a ""terrorist attack.""One report said the target appeared to be supporters of the security forces who were praying at the mosque.Local people are also quoted as saying that followers of Sufism, or Islamic mysticism, regularly gathered at the mosque.Islamist jihadist groups, including so-called Islamic State (IS), see Sufis as heretics.About 50 ambulances were rushed to the attack site to shift the injured to hospitals.No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack and there is no word yet on what happened to the terrorists involved. However, it bears the hallmarks of an attack by ISIS , reports said.There have been regular attacks blamed on terrorists on the Sinai peninsula since the January 2011 revolution that toppled former president Hosni Mubarak, but this is the deadliest assault of its kind.The attacks targeting police and military increased after the ouster of Islamist ex-president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 by military following massive protests against his rule.Over 700 security personnel have been reported killed since then.The military has launched security campaigns in the area, arrested suspects and demolished houses that belonged to terrorists, including those facilitating tunnels leading to the Gaza Strip.The Egypt government has announced three days of mourning, even as President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi chaired an emergency meeting with officials to review security situation after the deadly attack.Egypt has witnessed a series of terror attacks this year claiming scores of lives.On May 26, gunmen attacked a bus carrying Coptic Christians in central Egypt, killing at least 28 people and wounding 25 others.On April 9, two suicide bombings at Palm Sunday services at churches in the northern cities of Alexandria and Tanta left 46 people dead."

A precinct is a voting district in a town, city or county. Each precinct has a single polling place where voters cast ballots. Some precincts might contain thousands of voters, while others may have only a handful. In some states, tracking the percent of precincts reporting on election night is a reliable way to estimate how much of the vote has been tallied across the state. But as more people vote before Election Day, either in-person or by mail, reporting by precinct has become less reliable as a measure of the progress of the vote count in many states. That's because counties in some states don't include these advanced votes when reporting precinct results. Instead, they released the results of advance votes separately."

The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) has granted an interim relief in the issue to the Jeff Bezosled Amazon, for now, two people aware of the matter said. Earlier this month, Amazon had approached SIAC over its dispute with Future Coupons, one of the holding companies of Biyani’s Future Group, where Amazon had invested Rs 1,431 crore, citing breach of terms due to its sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries. This was preceded with a legal notice from Amazon to Future Group. While an interim order puts the merger on hold, the matter will continue to be heard at SIAC before the sole arbitrator, former attorney general of Singapore, comes to a decision. Legal experts said, typically, it’s the party dissatisfied with the international arbitration order that takes the matter to Indian courts, but Amazon might have to approach the Indian courts too, depending on the final order. “This was an emergency arbitration hearing, where they (Amazon) sought an interim stay on the merger so that the Future-Reliance deal doesn’t close formally, while the matter is in international arbitration,” a person aware of the development said. The development comes even as Reliance Industries has applied for a clearance with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on its deal with Future Group. Sources aware of the matter said the arbitration proceedings could go on for several weeks before a final order comes. This could also have an impact on banks that have lent to Biyani’s Future Group as the lenders are reportedly worried over their loans turning into non-performing assets (NPAs) owing to arbitration proceedings delaying the merger. “We welcome the award of the emergency arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought. We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process,” a spokesperson of Amazon said on Sunday.

Paytm said it aims to support one million apps on its recently launched Android Mini App Store as part of its efforts to support Indian developers and compete against tech giant Google. The company will also invest Rs 10 crore for the app developers on its platform. Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma - who has been vociferously voicing his concerns around the 'monopolistic' behaviour of the US-based company - said with its steep 30 per cent fee, Google has started to play the role of a 'toll collector' instead of enabling the ecosystem. He added that the company is committed to developing India's technology ecosystem. Paytm had said over 300 app-based service providers have already joined the programme. These apps are expected to make their way to the Mini App Store soon. Paytm had announced the launch of its Android Mini App Store earlier this week, just weeks after Paytm's app was blocked from Google Play Store for a few hours for violating the Google's policy on sports betting activities.

Navratri is one of the most auspicious Hindu festival that is celebrated for nine-nights and ten-days. This festival is dedicated to Goddess Durga and her nine 'avatars' (incarnation). There are a total of four Navratris in a year, but only two of them: Chaitra Navratri and Sharad Navratri are most popular. Chaitra Navratri is celebrated in the Hindu month of Chaitra (March and April), while Sharad navratri is celebrated in autumn around the months of October-November.This year, Navratri festival starts on Saturday, October 17, 2020, and Navami Puja will be observed on Saturday, October 24, 2020.

Most of the faculty have thorough experience of teaching at reputed B-Schools of India like IIM's which help the students developing skills in emerging areas like Data Analytics, Financial Engineering. Possessing such skills helped in bagging job with Deloitte which offered me a package of 7.8 LPA.""""The success of our students during campus placements year-after-year can be attributed towards our flexible choice-based credit system and career mapping of all our students. In the first year itself, we try to understand the aspirations of every student and offer him or her customized career-path that can lead to the fulfillment of their dreams,"" said Satnam Singh Sandhu, Chancellor, Chandigarh University.

Delhi-based student lands research internship offer from over 10 world-famous universities,,"NEW DELHI: Achieving world-class education in a world-renowned university is every scholar's dream but is often marred by the cost of living and exorbitant tuition fees.At times, these dreams get dashed at the selection level of some top-notch universities as students are not passed-out from renowned institutions.An Indian student, however, has not only defied the norms but has gone on to receive offers to intern with more than 10 universities, which several scholars yearn to go to but seldom get a chance.Delhi-based Abhishek Agrahari, an engineering student, is on cloud nine after internship offers came his way from the UK's University of Oxford and the USA's Pennsylvania State University and the University of Illinois, among others.""It feels great that I have received offers from so many renowned universities. The hard work has finally paid off,"" Agrahari told ANI.He previously worked with some stellar institutes like Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on gas turbine engine and IIT Bombay on fluid-structure interaction, and IIT Kanpur on fluid dynamics and has offers from the institute's centres in Kharagpur, Indore and Madras.For Agrahari, the love for research stems from the fact that he does not believe in following the mainstream and the constant urge of exploring something new every day.""Research has attracted me from the very beginning as I do not like following what has been done in the mainstream. I constantly wanted to explore something new. I like to research into subjects like fluids, the black hole,"" the 20-year-old added.Brighter the sunshine, darker the shadow. There are questions from detractors about him opting for foreign universities over the Indian institutes. Agrahari feels that after working with premier organisations like DRDO and IIT, it's time for some international exposure.""The foreign universities are slightly advanced in terms of infrastructure, quality of research as compared to what we are performing. Plus, you also get a great deal of international exposure as well,"" he said.But this success didn't come to him easily. He had to face his share of challenges during his graduation days and later as he was a ""non-IIT"" college and said that whatever student comes from IIT ""would be the superior ones"" -- a perception that he believes exists.""They (the universities) blindly believe in the IIT students rather than giving students who studied from private universities a chance. The entire process was very difficult for me,"" he said, adding that convincing the interviewers was not a cakewalk.Agrahari said that he has to study from other sources for his research as the topics that he is focussing on are not taught at the bachelor's level and they are mostly researched during the post-doctoral or PhD level.One would term it as extremely fascinating as he idolises British business magnate Richard Branson and holocaust victim, Anne Frank, as these are two completely unrelated to his field. ""His books, the thought process is something I really appreciate -- he is a multi-talented personality. I take so much inspiration from such personalities as they are the jack and the master of all trades,"" he said.When asked about what university he would choose to pursue his internship in, he replied that he would be doing so at the University of Oxford in January next year. ""Most likely, I will be setting out for oxford in January coming year 2021. There's a lot of paperwork to be done to facilitate the visa and departure. However, I am also in talking terms with two or three other institutes in USA,"" he added.While entering the gates of Harvard, Oxford and Yale to go to class might seem far-fetched, but the key to the dream lies in one's sincerity, hard work and honesty with the goal is worked upon, said the 20-year-old. ""I always believed that if they (IITans) could get there, why can't I?"" he concluded."

Jee Main Marks vs Percentile: How JEE Main percentile score calculated?,,"100 X Number of candidates appeared in the 'Session' with raw score equal to or less than the candidate (divided by)

NEW DELHI: National Testing Agency (NTA) had last week released the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main January 2020 results on its official website.The result was announced after normalization of the scores. The normalization of scores is done to root out any doubts that the question paper of a particular shift was easy/difficult then the other shift. The normalization process gives each and every candidates of scoring marks irrespective of the difficulty level of his/her paper.NTA Scores are normalized scores across multi session papers and are based on the relative performance of all those who appeared for the examination in one session. The marks obtained are converted into a scale ranging from 100 to 0 for each session.The process of Normalization is an established practice for comparing candidate scores across multi session papers and is similar to those being adopted in other large educational selection tests conducted in India. Normalization across sections, NTA shall use the percentile equivalence.Percentile scores are scores based on the relative performance of all those who appear for the examination. Basically the marks obtained are transformed into a scale ranging from 100 to 0 for each session of examinees.The Percentile Score indicates the percentage of candidates that have scored EQUAL TO OR BELOW (same or lower raw scores) that particular Percentile in that examination. Therefore the topper(highest score) of each session will get the same Percentile of 100 which is desirable. The marks obtained in between the highest and lowest scores are also converted to appropriate Percentiles.The Percentile Scores is calculated up to seven decimal places to avoid bunching effect and reduce ties.The Percentile score of a Candidate is calculated as follows:100 X Number of candidates appeared in the 'Session' with raw score equal to or less than the candidateThe Percentile of the Total shall not be an aggregate or average of the Percentile of individual subject. Percentile score is not the same as percentage of marks obtained.The overall merit / ranking is based on the Percentile scores of the Total Raw Scores. In case of two or more candidates obtainingequal Percentile Scores in the Test, the inter-se merit of such candidates will be determined in order of preference as follows:(a) Candidates obtaining higher Percentile Score in Mathematics in the Test.(b) Candidates obtaining higher Percentile Score in Physics in the Test.(c) Candidates obtaining higher Percentile Score in Chemistry in the Test.(d) Candidates older in age to be preferred."

"Abducted &amp; killed, no breakthrough in sibling murders yet",,"Gumla: Two siblings — a brother and his sister — were abducted in their own car and killed by unidentified persons under Ghaghra police station of Gumla on Sunday night. Identified as Sanjiv Ranjan Bhagat (27) and Mamta Khakha (22), their bodies were found from two different places on Monday, police said.

While Sanjiv’s body was recovered from a playground, Mamta was found floating in a pond nearby at Chundri Navatoli village, police said.

According to reports, Sanjiv and Mamta were returning from Lohardaga district to their native village Kotamati under Ghaghra police station when the incident occurred.

Rims junior docs threaten strike after dead patient’s kin thrash female colleagues,,"Ranchi: In yet another incident of scuffle between patient’s kin and junior doctors at the state’s largest government-run hospital Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences ( Rims ), a junior doctor was allegedly attacked by a few members of a dead patient on late Monday night.

According to hospital sources, a second year PG doctor of the medicine department was attacked by the patient’s kin of Pramod Singh, a resident of Dhanbad admitted around a week ago with chronic kidney and heart ailments. The patient was provided consultations of specialists from cardiology and nephrology department. When he passed away, the patient’s kin attacked the on-duty doctors alleging negligence.

On Tuesday, a representative of Junior Doctor Association (JDA) met dean and director of Rims and demanded adequate security at hospital premises at all times and said they go on a strike from Tuesday midnight if their demands are not met. They also threatened to not report for OPD duties.

Talking to TOI, Dr Anitesh Gupta of JDA said, “The patient was already admitted with serious kidney and heart complications and he died of natural cases during treatment. No one can be blamed for this. But, the manner in which the patient’s kin attacked three female doctors on duty is totally unacceptable and we have submitted a written complaint to Bariatu police station and have demanded immediate arrest of culprits.”

Meanwhile, the patient’s kin alleged that they did not misbehave with the doctors and their patient passed away as proper care wasn’t provided to him. They also said that the doctors kept the dead body till Tuesday afternoon just to “harass” them.

“We didn’t misbehave with any female doctor. Only a few ladies from our side had tried to confront the female doctors as they hadn’t taken proper care. In fact, the doctors threatened us that they will ensure that the dead body isn’t released,” said a family member of the dead patient.

Bariatu police station in-charge Sapan Mahatha said, “No case has been registered yet and we are investigating the matter.”

"Officers will be liable for answers, says Jharkhand DGP",,"Ranchi: Police officers, including SPs, will be held accountable in case of crimes against women in their respective areas of jurisdiction, DGP M V Rao said on Tuesday.

Addressing media persons at the state police headquarters here, Rao said, ""Police officers must ensure that such crimes do not happen by working on actionable information promptly.

He further said, ""If such crimes like suspicious deaths of women and girls do happen, the SPs concerned must visit the spots and conduct probes without delay so that the cases reach the court soon. Chargesheets must also be filed on time to fast-track the hearings. These actions will reduce police negligence.""

Rao added, ""The SPs are accountable for timely investigation and submission of chargesheets in crimes against women. A standard operating procedure is being prepared for the purpose.""

Highlighting that chief minister Hemant Soren has assured to provide the necessary resources for investigation into crimes, particularly against women, the DGP asked all ranks and files of the force to be deligent in their work.

He also said a WhatsApp number for women and children facing harassment or any sex-related crime to file complaints has been floated a week ago. ""So far, we have received 108 complaints and most of them were related to abuses. Will study the complaints for the next six to eight weeks to identify the trends, hotposts, target groups and other aspects for framing policies.""

Stating that the number of cases related to stalking, sexual harassment and blackmail are very few so far, Rao said, ""There are several complaints related to blank calls, which we are investigating.”

Rao, however, said, ""There were nearly a dozen complaints related to sexual exploitation on the promise of marriage. We have started filing cases and investigations into them.""

Among the districts with highest cases recieved through the WhatsApp number are Ranchi (28), Giridih (18) and East Singhbhum (12), he added.

Warning the public against any wrongdoing, he said, ""We will take strict action against those who try to suppress rape cases by holding khap panchayat-like meetings.""

The top cop also said anyone found engaging in rash driving would be taken to task. ""We have CCTV cameras installed at all strategic points. Moreover, interceptor vehicles are always on stand-by to identify and catch the violators,"" he said.

""Moreover, DSPs will be held responsible for rash driving in their areas. They will also be held accountable if any illegal liquor and drug sale in their areas,"" Rao said.

On Bihar election, the DGP said police and para-military forces have carried out intensive operations in districts bordering the neighbouring state for the past several days and seized large scale amounts of contraband items.

Notably, police have set up 50 checkposts along the border with Bihar to prevent inter-state smuggling of illicit liquor and drugs, and movement of criminals and extremists.

Rao said in the past one month, they have seized several weapons, including seven country made pistols, 103 ammunition, 100 detonators and 200 gleatin sticks. As many as 13 persons have been arrested in connection with the seizures.

Further, police have seized 4,642 litres of country made liquor, 1,495 litres of foreign liquor and arrested 89 persons. As many as 1,093 non-bailable warrants were filed while property attachments were done in 85 cases.

In addition, 86 kg of ganja, 537 kg of doda, over 18 kg of opium, 62 gram of brown sugar and five pieces of hasish were also recovered.

Rao said police would also start a two-week drive against sale of narcotics and illegal liquor from November 1.

Will drive out BJP with lathis: Jharkhand CM,,"Dumka: Chief minister Hemant Soren, who is currently camping in Dumka, on Tuesday said he will drive away BJP with lathis (sticks) and dandas (batons). Hemant and his father, JMM chief Shibu Soren, are both engaged in hectic campaigning for Basant Soren, who has been fielded by the tribal party in Dumka.

Party insiders said Hemant will also visit Bermo and parts of Bihar to campaigning in favour of the candidates of parties in alliance. Hemant reached here last evening and addressed eight meetings in Dumka sadar block area on Tuesday.

“The bypoll result in no way will affect our government as we already have 50 MLAs. Yet your support in the bypolls will strengthen our might to the extent to drive away BJP with lathis and dandas,” Hemant said while addressing a gathering at Lakhikundi locality.

Hemant’s offensive against the saffron party is in the backdrop of BJP’s claims of replacing his government after winning the bypolls from both the seats.

Hemant also addressed election meetings in the outskirts of the sub-capital town, including in Asansol, Kumrabad, Kesiyabahal, Baskichak, Basjora, Kusumdih and Mahua Dangal till late evening on Tuesday.

Shibu, who arrived here on a chopper, sought blessings from the electorate for Basant.

“Guruji will be meeting with party cadres and common people at his Khijuriya residence and accompany Hemant to places where choppers cannot land from tomorrow (Wednesday) onwards,” Vijay Kumar Singh, the central committee member of JMM said.

Ritik, when he came home, told his family members that he beaten badly.” After the cops allegedly thrashed him at Isanpur police station, he was sent to the remand home where he was kept alone in a separate room where the staffers of the remand home also tortured him, Gangaram said.“On Tuesday at around 6am, a staffer from the remand room called Ritik’s parents, telling them that he was critically ill and was taken to the Asarwa Civil Hospital. When they rushed there, they found their child dead,” said Gangaram. A panel postmortem was done and police registered a case of accidental death."
Public bus operators threaten to go to court over tax waiver,,"Panaji: The All Goa Private Bus Owners’ Association has threatened to go to court if the state government fails to waive off their taxes for the lockdown months. The association’s general secretary, Sudeep Tamankar, pointed out how operators of taxis, buses , motorcycles and auto-rickshaws have been devoid of income during the pandemic.

“We want the passenger tax and road tax waived. We have already sent several representations to the state government in this regard, to give us tax relaxation for the lockdown months, yet there is no response. Has the government quarantined itself?” he said.

Tamankar said the financial dent to their businesses, caused by the imposition of tax, may compel some to suspend operations. As a result, he said, ancillary services such as mechanics, tyre changers and other small workers solely dependent on public transport for a living, will also be affected.

Further, he said private bus operators have on multiple occasions personally visited the transport department to share their grievances, but to no avail.

“The transport director refuses to come out of his cabin. His officers don’t let anyone in and the peon lies saying there is no one inside. Such is the treatment meted out to us. We have even asked the chief minister for an appointment multiple times, but there has been no response,” he said.

“What is left now for us is to demand help from Prime Minister Narendra Modi since he imposed the lockdown, thus affecting our business. If state government officials don’t respond to us, we will either have to petition the government in the high court or undertake a protest,” he said.

Josep Maria Bartomeu: Barcelona in turmoil as president resigns,2020-10-27 00:00:00,"(CNN) A major shake-up is underway at Barcelona after Josep Maria Bartomeu resigned as club president with immediate effect.

Bartomeu had stood firm amid increasing scrutiny but announced he and the entire board of directors would step down during an explosive press conference on Tuesday.

The 57-year-old had become a divisive figure during his near seven-year spell at the club and was facing a vote of no confidence next month after fans and club members had called for him to leave.

Most recently, Bartomeu had been the focus of a very public fallout with Lionel Messi after the Argentine had requested to leave the club this year.

Messi criticized the former president for not keeping his word and only stayed to avoid taking his beloved club to court.

Real Madrid scores dramatic last-minute equalizer in the Champions League,2020-10-27 00:00:00,"(CNN) A last-minute goal from Casemiro completed a stunning comeback from Real Madrid on Tuesday that earned the Spanish giants its first point of the new Champions League campaign.

Madrid had been trailing German outfit Borussia Monchengladbach 2-0 until the 87th minute before the visitors mounted a late surge to avoid humiliation and a fourth consecutive defeat in the competition.

Talismanic striker Karim Benzema dragged one back for his side with an acrobatic finish before Brazilian Casemiro fired into the roof of the net in stoppage time to tie the scores 2-2.

The two late goals canceled out Marcus Thuram's double for Monchengladbach, which will be devastated not to earn a famous victory against its powerhouse opponents.

""We didn't think it was going to be a drama. The team has shown reaction,"" said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane after the match.

Lionel Messi says he 'only wanted to make FC Barcelona better and stronger' after failed attempt to leave the club,2020-09-30 00:00:00,"(CNN) Lionel Messi says he had Barcelona's best interests at heart when announcing that he wanted to leave the club in August.

The Argentine and the Barcelona board, specifically president Josep Bartomeu, became embroiled in a bitter public dispute after Messi sent a letter informing them of his desire find a new club.

The 33-year-old admitted he had wanted to leave ""all year"" and claimed a clause in his contract meant he could do so for free, but in the end the Argentine was forced to stay as Barcelona disagreed and wasn't willing to reduce its €700 million ($897 million) release clause.

Messi said his love for the club meant he had no intention of disputing the club's decision in court and dragging out a legal dispute."

Real Madrid edge Barcelona to spoil what could be Lionel Messi's final home El Clasico,2020-10-24 00:00:00,"(CNN) Real Madrid spoiled what could be Lionel Messi's final El Clasico at the Camp Nou, beating its bitter rival Barcelona 3-1.

The away side took the lead inside the opening five minutes, a penetrating run from Karim Benzema splitting the Barcelona defense before he could slip the ball through to the driving Fede Valverde to smash home.

It didn't take long for Barcelona to level however, with Messi perhaps unsurprisingly at the heart of it. His incisive through-ball to Jordi Alba split the Madrid defense allowing the left-back to lay the ball on a plate for 17-year-old Ansu Fati

The away side retook the lead midway through the second half from the penalty spot as captain Sergio Ramos nonchalantly converted before a late Luka Modric goal wrapped up the three points.

The defeat is Barcelona's second in a row, while Real Madrid got back to winning ways.

""We played a perfect game. It's three points, nothing more,"" Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane said afterwards.

""We've faced a lot of criticism over the past few days. We have to remain calm and play the way we want to play. I'm happy for the players. It was a team victory today. I'm proud of my side.""

Messi looks on during the match against Real Madrid.

To and fro

During the opening stages of an extraordinary season, Barcelona and Real Madrid have shown signs of fallibility.

Both of the Spanish giants lost their last outings in the Spanish league, while Real Madrid was stunned at home on Wednesday by an under-manned Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League.

But travelling to an empty Camp Nou, the reigning Spanish La Liga champions showed no hint of nerves in the early stages of El Clasico, the fiery and fierce rivalry between the two.

French striker Benzema, driving through the wide-open Barcelona defense in the opening minutes, was able to pick out a completely unmarked Valverde who had darted between players into the box to get the scoring started.

Valverde (right) scores against Barcelona.

But as they showed on Wednesday against Shakhtar Donetsk, Real struggled to keep the opposition at bay and like he has been so often before, it was Messi at the heart of Barcelona's excellent attacking.

His delightfully weighted pass just three minutes later from the halfway line fell almost perfectly into the stride of a galloping Alba who was able to square for Fati to emphatically finish.

In scoring, Fati became the youngest player to score in El Clasico in all competitions in the 21st century at the age of 17 years and 359 days.

While no more goals followed in the first half, both sides put on a show for the fans watching at home, with no spectators allowed into the Camp Nou because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

It was more of the same after the break until a careless tug of Ramos' jersey from Barcelona defender Clement Lenglet was caught by the video assistant referee (VAR). After awarding the penalty, Ramos duly stepped up to put the Madrid side ahead once again.

Ramos became the first Real player to score a penalty in El Clasico in the league since Ruud van Nistelrooy in March 2007.

""We couldn't allow ourselves to get bogged down in that bad run,"" Ramos said afterwards. ""It was a sh*t week but we put the criticism to one side. It's always good to win away at a direct rival. Two games is a crisis at Real Madrid but we have to carry on doing things our way.""

And although they huffed and puffed, Barcelona could not find a way back into the game and Modric's jabbed finish finally sealed the game in the dying moments.

""I think we played well,"" Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman said after the game. ""I think we created good opportunities to score. Some parts of the game we were the better team and it's difficult to understand because we did not deserve to lose the game today.""

Modric celebrates after scoring against Barcelona.

An unhappy end

Having spent the whole of his professional career at Barcelona, it is hard to imagine Messi would have envisioned the end of his time at the Catalan club being this messy.

The 33-year-old announced that he wanted to leave the club in August and has admitted he had wanted to leave ""all year.""

He claimed a clause in his contract meant he could do so for free, but in the end the Argentine was forced to stay as Barcelona disagreed and wasn't willing to reduce its €700 million ($897 million) release clause.

Messi said his love for the club meant he had no intention of disputing the club's decision in court and dragging out a legal dispute.

Messi receives medical attention after being tackled during the game against Real Madrid.

And with the chances of him staying on after this season looking increasingly unlikely, there is a chance that today's El Clasico could be the final one at Camp Nou for the diminutive Argentine.

Without the opportunity to appear at home in front of Barcelona fans, it will be a disappointing final appearance in El Clasico for Messi after the success he has brought the club in his 20 years there.

The Argentine has helped Barcelona win 10 league titles and four Champions League trophies, as well as winning six Ballon d'Or's himself."

"El Clasico may not have the same allure as years gone by, but Camp Nou meeting still intrigues",2020-10-23 00:00:00,"(CNN) Saturday's El Clasico will be an El Clasico like no other. Widely viewed as the most watched club game in the world, when Barcelona take on Real Madrid at the Camp Nou this weekend, the match will be played behind closed doors.

""The game will be strange, as when you play at home in these kinds of games the fans are almost an extra man,"" Ronald Koeman told the Barcelona website. ""We hope that soon we can have our supporters back at the stadium.""

But this latest installment in the El Clasico series is also unusual in that it could be the last time Lionel Messi features against Real at the Camp Nou.

Between 2009 and 2018 the rivalry between Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo was the beguiling sub-plot to each El Clasico meeting.

However long gone are the days when fans would marvel at the sight of Ronaldo and Messi doing battle at the peak of their careers. In fact, Ronaldo is gone completely, now plying his trade at Juventus, and Messi ... well, Messi wishes he was gone, too.

Barcelona looks to be counting the cost of forcing a player -- the best player in the club's history, no less -- to stay against his wishes, with Messi's performances dipping this season after publicly saying he had wanted to leave ""all year.""

The Argentine, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers in history, has since said he remains motivated to bring success to Barcelona this season, but that is certainly easier said than done once your heart is set on a move away.

Ansu Fati celebrates with Lionel Messi after scoring a goal during the UEFA Champions League football match between FC Barcelona and Ferencvarosi TC at the Camp Nou stadium on Tuesday.

Messi's performances have understandably dipped way below his own supernatural standards, with only two goals in five games so far this season and both of those coming from the penalty spot.

Fortunately for Barcelona, it has a thrilling new prospect on its hands in 17-year-old Ansu Fati, who is providing fans with hope that there may yet be life after Messi.

Fati, who became Spain's youngest ever goalscorer in the recent international break, already has four goals in five games this season to cement his place as Barcelona's top scorer.

New boss Koeman had guided Barcelona to a solid start in La Liga, with two wins and a draw from his opening three games as head coach. However, last Saturday's surprise 1-0 defeat to Getafe exposed many of the flaws that have plagued Barcelona in recent times.

It's no secret that the team has been painfully overly reliant on Messi over the past few seasons and it may now finally have to find a way to succeed without leaning heavily on the Argentine's shoulders.

The wounds from that 8-2 Champions League humiliation to Bayern Munich in last season's quarterfinals remain fresh and, perhaps most worryingly of all, Barcelona has arguably only fallen even further behind the standards currently being set by Bavarian club.

Messi shakes hands with Barca coach Ronald Koeman after he is substituted during the pre-season friendly match between FC Barcelona and Girona at Estadi Johan Cruyff on September 16, 2020.

Tuesday's 5-1 win against Hungarian club Ferencvaros will have earned Barcelona some brief respite, but triumphing in an El Clasico will do wonders for Koeman's standing at the Catalan club.

Clash of the crisis clubs

Fortunately for Barcelona, Saturday's El Clasico certainly won't be a match Real Madrid is relishing either.

Zinedine Zidane's side has endured an even more turbulent few days than their rivals, following up its shock weekend defeat to newly-promoted Cadiz -- playing in its first La Liga season for 15 years -- with an equally surprising home defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League.

With one eye on Saturday's La Liga clash against Barcelona, Real made several changes to its regular starting lineup, but there could be no excuses for such an insipid and lifeless first-half performance.

Shakhtar Donetsk beat Real Madrid 3-2 in a stunning Champions League win on Wednesday.

Incredibly, Shakhtar was without seven starting players -- and 10 in total -- due to a combination of positive coronavirus cases and injuries.

""I've won a lot with these players, they've won a lot for me and I'll always be with them until the end, it's they who battle, run and fight and I can feel their support,"" said Zidane, per Reuters, looking ahead to Saturday's game.

""But right now the most important thing is changing the dynamic, and we've got good games coming up to be able to do that in, and that's what makes football so great. When things go wrong, you need to show your character and quality.

""I can't deny people are saying my future is at stake, but it was the same last year and it was like that in my first spell here, too. I just need to do my job and forget about everything else.""

Real Madrid has gradually improved since Zidane was re-hired as head coach in March 2019, its resurgence culminating a first La Liga title since 2017 at the end of last season -- though perhaps, in hindsight, that win was more by proxy given Barcelona's shambolic form following the restart.

Much like Barcelona, Real has some exciting prospects that are allowing fans to dream the future may be bright. Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior has continued his development as one of Europe's finest attacking players, while left-back Ferland Mendy is cementing his place as Marcelo's heir apparent.

For both clubs, it remains to be seen whether the recent results and performances are just a small blip or an indication of the struggles ahead this season.

Real coach Zinedine Zidane has presided over successive defeats -- first to Cadiz in La Liga and then Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League.

While Real and Barca may no longer be at their previous peaks, perhaps more accurately resembling two lumbering heavyweight boxers in the twilight of their careers, the precarious position in which both teams and managers find themselves arguably makes Saturday's clash an even more meaningful occasion."
Shakhtar Donetsk produces stunning Champions League upset to defeat 13-time winner Real Madrid,2020-10-21 00:00:00,"(CNN) Shakhtar Donetsk produced one of the most memorable upsets in Champions League history, beating 13-time winner Real Madrid 3-2 on home soil.

First-half strikes from Tete and Manor Solomon either side of a Raphael Varane own goal gave the Ukrainian side a commanding lead, before Real pulled two back early in the second period through Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior.

Despite a sustained period of pressure late on from the Spanish champion, including a last-minute goal rightly disallowed by VAR for offside, Shakhtar held on for a famous win.

To make the result even more incredible, Shakhtar was without seven starting players -- and 10 in total -- due to a combination of positive coronavirus cases and injuries.

The defeat caps a miserable few days for Real, which suffered another shock defeat at the weekend to newly promoted Cadiz. Coach Zinedine Zidane, who cut a helpless and bemused figure on the sidelines, has plenty of work to do ahead of El Clasico against bitter rival Barcelona on Saturday.

Real Madrid's players look bewildered as Shakhtar scores its third goal.

A night to remember

There were certainly several warning signs early on for Real, which started the match looking sluggish and lazy. Those in white were second to every loose ball and Shakhtar's young, inexperienced team looked to have an extra spring in its step.

Real began its domestic campaign in impressive form, winning three and drawing one of its opening four matches and looked to have picked up where it left off at the end of last season.

However, at the weekend the team looked lackluster against Cadiz, playing in its first top-flight Spanish campaign for 15 years, and was convincingly outplayed. Many wondered whether it was just a small blip or an insight into some early issues Zidane would be facing this season.

Wednesday's match would certainly have done nothing to allay those concerns.

Shakhtar's bright start was soon rewarded, with the visitor taking deserved lead just before the half hour mark and Real's early defensive frailties were brutally exposed.

Following a slick passing move out from defense, Viktor Korniienko was allowed the slalom into the box relatively unopposed and lay the ball off to Tete, who kept his composure and stroked the ball into the bottom corner.

Tete celebrates after doubling Shakhtar's lead.

With one eye on this coming weekend's La Liga clash against Barcelona, Real made several changes to its regular starting lineup, but there could be no excuses for this insipid, lifeless first-half performance.

Things would only go from bad to worse and less than four minutes later, Shakhtar had doubled its lead. Tete was again at the heart of the attack and his shot was this time saved by Real goalkeeper Thibault Courtois, only for Raphael Varane to poke the ball into his own net as he tried to make an awkward clearance.

Due to its 81,000 capacity Santiago Bernabeu undergoing renovations, Real Madrid has been playing all of its matches since the enforced coronavirus break at its Alfredo Di Stefano training center and most of these players had certainly approached this tie with all the intensity of a training match.

Then, just minutes before half time, Shakhtar looked to have put the game beyond Real as Solomon latched onto Tete's brilliant back heel and slotted to ball calmly into the bottom corner.

By this point, even Zidane could only muster a bewildered smirk, but there would be few smiles in that Real changing room at half time.

Zinedine Zidane looked on in bemusement as Shakhtar stunned Real Madrid.

Whatever the coach said to his players during the interval clearly had the desired effect, as two goals from Modric and Vinicius in the space of five minutes early in the second half gave Real hope of salvaging at least a point.

Unsurprisingly, it was Real that dominated the majority of the second period but Shakhtar still presented a consistent threat on the counterattack and Tete had a glorious opportunity to put the game to bed, only to see his shot saved by Courtois.

In the game's dying seconds, Real thought it had snatched an equalizer as Federico Valverde deflected shot squirmed past Shakhtar goalkeeper Anatolii Trubin.

However, after a brief VAR review, referee Srdjan Jovanovic ruled the goal out for offside with Vinicius stood in an offside position and obscuring Trubin's view.

The final whistle blew just moments later, sparking wild scenes as the Shakhtar bench emptied and stormed the pitch in celebration.

Defending champion impresses

Elsewhere, defending champion Bayern Munich laid down an early marker with an eye-catching 4-0 win at home to Atletico Madrid.

Many had this down as the most intriguing tie of the first round of fixtures, with both of these teams among the favorites to reach the latter stages of this season's competition.

Certainly, most would have expected a closer game than this and, worryingly for Bayern's rivals, the Bavarian club was nowhere near its best. Atletico Madrid had plenty of chances, in particular in the first half, but was wasteful when in front of goal.

Kingsley Coman celebrates after scoring Bayern's fourth goal.

Kingsley Coman, the hero in last season's Champions League final, was at the heart of Bayern's victory, scoring two goals and assisting another for Leon Goretzka.

Corentin Tolisso put the game beyond doubt just after the hour mark with a thunderous drive from distance after the ball had ricocheted back out to him.

Coman's second -- Bayern's fourth -- was a stunning solo effort, the French winger twisted and turned through Atletico's porous defense and slotted the ball past Jan Oblak into the far corner.

Only one team in Champions League history, Zidane's Real Madrid, has previously won back-to-back titles, but Bayern has a realistic chance of doing the same this season."
Melania Trump focuses on Covid and slams Democrats for politicizing pandemic,2020-10-27 00:00:00,"(CNN) First lady Melania Trump focused on the Covid-19 pandemic in her first solo campaign event of 2020 and blasted Democrats for allegedly politicizing the pandemic.

Melania directly attacked Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on the coronavirus, claiming: ""Now he suggests that he could have done a better job. Well, the American people can look at Joe Biden's 36 years in Congress and eight years in the vice presidency and determine whether they think he'll finally be able to get something done for the American people.""

The first lady also spoke about her family's struggle with the virus and demonstrated compassion for those suffering the virus -- something rarely done by President Donald Trump in rallies.

""Like many of you, I have experienced the firsthand effects of Covid-19 -- not only as a patient -- but as a worried mother and wife. I know there are many people who have lost loved ones or know people who have been forever impacted by this silent enemy,"" Melania Trump said in Pennsylvania.

The first lady's first solo campaign appearance comes with just one week to go before the election. Her up-to-now campaign trail absence has marked a historic break from precedent, especially in a race that finds her husband fighting for votes.

7 days from Election Day -- Here's what we know about who's voted so far in key states,2020-10-27 00:00:00,"(CNN) One week from Election Day , early voters so far are younger, more racially diverse and more likely to be Democrats than they were ahead of the 2016 election in many of the key states that could decide the next president.

More than 65.5 million votes have already been cast around the US, surpassing the 58.3 million total pre-election votes cast in 2016. That's almost half of the total presidential votes cast four years ago.

While these are trends that could benefit Democrats , including the party's presidential nominee Joe Biden, they're not predictive of the final results. Polling shows that Republicans are much more likely to say they prefer to vote on Election Day this year, and an early vote counts just the same as one cast on November 3.

Detailed voting information on these key states comes from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations and is giving insights into who is voting before November.

Here's a look at who has already voted in some of the most competitive states this cycle.

Arizona

Young voters (those between the ages of 18 and 29) make up twice as large a share of early voters in Arizona as they did at this point in 2016. Those voters made up 5% of early voters in 2016; now they make up 10%.

Meanwhile, voters 65 or older have gone from 50% of early voters in 2016 to 41% now.

The share of White early voters in Arizona has dipped slightly from this point in 2016, decreasing from 77% four years ago to 74% currently. Hispanic voters account for the second largest share of ballots already cast at 15%, up from 13% in 2016. Black voters and Asian voters have seen one percentage-point upticks in each of their shares of the early vote as well.

Democrats have overtaken Republicans this year in pre-election ballots cast so far. At this time before the 2016 election, Republicans made up 41% of the ballots cast, with Democrats trailing behind at 37%. Today, Democrats make up 41% of the pre-election vote, with Republicans comprising 34%.

Colorado

In Colorado , where every voter receives a mail-in ballot, the electorate so far is younger than it was at this point in 2016. Then, about 6% of people who had already voted were under 30. Now, that's 11%.

Voters 30-49 also account for more of the ballots that have been cast this year compared to this point in 2016, while voters 65 or older account for a smaller share.

Hispanic voters have expanded their share of the pre-election vote -- 8% last cycle to 10% now.

White voters account for the vast majority of ballots already cast in Colorado, although their share of those ballots has decreased from this time four years from 85% to 83% now.

The Republican share of the pre-election vote is down seven points from a week before the 2016 election, while Democrats are at about the same level.

Florida

Young voters in Florida have almost doubled their share of the votes cast so far compared to this point in 2016. Voters 65 or older made up 50% of the early vote at this time four years ago, but only make up 41% now.

JUST WATCHED Hear Trump speak after voting in person in Florida Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hear Trump speak after voting in person in Florida 02:41

Florida's early voting electorate is slightly more diverse compared to this point in 2016. Both Hispanic voters and Black voters have increased their shares of ballots already cast, with Hispanic voters accounting for about 16% of the early vote (up from 14% in 2016) and Black voters at 13% (up from 12% in 2016).

Democrats are leading in the pre-election turnout with 42% of the ballots cast to the Republicans' 36%. A week before the 2016 election, they were tied at 41% each.

Georgia

Biden campaigns in the Peach State Tuesday, which Trump won by about five points in the last presidential election.

Early voting in Georgia has already surpassed 2016 pre-election voting, and it's reached almost 73% of the total votes cast in the state four year ago.

As in other states, voters under 30 in Georgia account for a larger share of the early vote than they did four years ago. Voters 30-39 have also seen an increase from 9% of the pre-election vote at this point four years ago to 12% now.

Georgia has the largest share of pre-election votes from Black voters of these key states, at 31%, about the same as this time four years ago. White voters' share of the pre-Election Day vote has dropped from 65% in 2016 to 62% currently.

Iowa

More than 750,000 ballots have already been cast, according to Iowa 's Secretary of State's office, surpassing the total 2016 pre-election vote. It represents almost half all votes cast in the 2016 presidential election.

Democrats are up significantly in their share of ballots cast so far this year, making up 50% of those ballots. At this time before the 2016 election, their share was 44%. Republicans are currently about the same at 31%.

The age breakdown of early voters in Iowa hasn't changed as much since 2016 as it has in some other states. 10% of the state's early voters so far have been under the age of 30, up only 3 points from this time four years ago. Voters 30-64 also make up a slightly larger share of the electorate compared to 2016. Four years ago, those voters made up 41% of those who had already cast ballots; now they're 47%.

Michigan

2020 is Michigan's first general election since a ballot measure passed to allow anyone to cast a vote by mail, and the age breakdown of the state's early voters has changed dramatically. At this point four years ago, 80% of the state's early voters were 65 or older. Now, those voters make up 46% of those who have cast ballots. Voters under 30 only accounted for 2% of the ballots cast at this point four years ago; now they account for 9%.

While Michigan has already surpassed its total number of pre-election votes cast in 2016, it isn't seeing the same levels of pre-election voting as some other states with longer traditions of early or mail-in voting. So far, voting in the state accounts for almost 44% of the total number of ballots cast in 2016.

Black voters in Michigan have expanded their share of ballots already cast compared to last cycle. They currently account for about 12% of those ballots, up from just 8% in 2016. Hispanic voters and Asian voters have also seen small upticks in their shares of the early vote. White voters' share of the early vote, meanwhile, has dropped from 89% in 2016 to 83% currently.

Minnesota

About 1.2 million ballots have already been cast in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, almost double the state's total 2016 pre-election vote.

Minnesota has seen a large swing in the age breakdown of early voters compared to 2016. Four years ago at this time, 58% of ballots had been cast by people 65 or older. Now, that's 38%.

Voters under 30 have cast almost 143,000 votes so far this year, good for 12% of all ballots cast. That's more than double their share of the early vote at this time four years ago.

Similar to this time last cycle, Minnesota's early voters so far are predominantly White -- 89% now vs. 92% then. Black voters, Hispanic voters and Asian voters have all seen one point increases in their shares of ballots already cast compared to four years ago.

Nevada

Younger voters make up 10% of Nevada voters so far. That's up from four years ago at this time when they made up 6%.

Hispanic voters in Nevada represent the second largest share of ballots cast so far at 13%, slightly up from 12% four years ago. Black voters and Asian voters have also seen one-percentage point increases in their pre-election vote shares. White voters' share of the early vote has decreased slightly from 2016, down from 70% then to 68% currently.

Democrats have held steady with the pre-election ballots cast at 43% -- the same as this time four years ago. Republicans have dropped in their share of the pre-election ballots from 38% back then to 34% now.

North Carolina

In North Carolina , 12% of voters so far are under the age of 30 -- almost double what it was at this point in 2016. Meanwhile, voters 65 and older dropped from 42% of the early vote at this time four years ago, to 33% now.

The breakdown of North Carolina's pre-election voters by race is nearly the same as it was in 2016. White voters account for 72% of those early ballots, Black voters for about 22% and Hispanic voters and Asian voters each for roughly 2%.

Democrats' 10-point lead in pre-election ballots cast is about the same as their 11-point lead at this time in 2016.

Ohio

Voters under the age of 30 have cast about 196,000 votes in Ohio so far, about 9% of the total and up from 6% at this point in 2016. Voters 30-64 increased their share from 41% a week before the 2016 election to 49% now.

By race, Ohio's early voting electorate is similar to what it was four years ago. White voters continue to account for a significant majority of ballots cast so far at 86%. Black voters comprise the second largest share of early voters at 10%, followed by Hispanic voters at 2% and Asian voters at 1%.

Pennsylvania

There is no Catalist data out of Pennsylvania for the last cycle. This year, young voters make up 11% of the more than 1.7 million ballots cast so far in the Keystone State, while 43% are over the age of 65.

White voters in Pennsylvania have cast the majority of pre-Election Day ballots so far, accounting for 82% of those ballots. Black voters represent the second largest share of early voters in the Keystone State at 11%, followed by Hispanic voters and Asian voters each at 3%.

Democrats continue to hold a significant advantage in pre-election voting, making up about 70% of those ballots cast. 2020 is the first year Pennsylvania expanded mail voting options to all voters, and Republicans in the state are expected to vote in larger numbers on Election Day, which would fall in line with polling that shows members of the GOP around the country prefer to vote in-person next Tuesday.

Texas

More than 7.8 million Texans have already voted this year. That's more than the total number who voted before Election Day in 2016 and about 87% of the state's total turnout from four years ago.

Younger voters in Texas are turning out to vote early this year in far greater numbers than at this point four years ago, with more than 850,000 ballots cast. They currently make up 12% of the pre-election vote, doubling the 6% of the share one week before the 2016 election.

Texas is one of the only key states where Black voters' share of ballots already cast has slightly decreased compared to four years ago. At this point in 2016, Black voters represented 15% of the ballots already cast; now they're at 13%. Hispanic voters continue to comprise the second largest share of those early voters at 20%, on par with 2016 levels.

White voters comprise 61% of the early vote, the smallest share of all the key states listed here. That number is about the same as it was at this time four years ago.

Wisconsin

More than 1.3 million people in Wisconsin have already voted -- almost half of the state's total 2016 presidential vote.

Wisconsin has seen a significant drop in the share of early voters who are 65 or older compared to this point in 2016. Four years ago, 52% of early voters were 65 or older. Now, those voters make up 38%."
India signs defensive agreement with US following Himalayan standoff with China,2020-10-27 00:00:00,"Hong Kong (CNN) The United States and India have reaffirmed their defensive and security relationship, as Washington continues to rally allies in Asia amid concerns over increased Chinese military activity in the region.

During a press conference Tuesday in the Indian capital, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh announced the signing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), enabling greater information-sharing and further defense cooperation between the two countries.

""The defense ties between our two nations remains a key pillar of our overall bilateral relationship,"" said Esper. ""Based on our shared values and common interests, we stand shoulder to shoulder in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific for all, particularly in light of increasing aggression and destabilizing activities by China.""

The agreement, said Singh furthered the two sides ongoing commitment to the ""law and freedom of navigation in the international seas"" while ""upholding the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states.""

Both India and the US are due to participate in the upcoming Malabar naval exercises which will be held in the Indian Ocean next month. The drills will feature all members of the so-called Quad , an informal alliance of the US, India, Japan and Australia, which has been proposed by some as a potential ""Asian NATO,"" intended to counterbalance Chinese military strength in the region."
Italy protests turn violent as anger mounts over Covid-19 measures,2020-10-27 00:00:00,"Rome (CNN) Protesters have clashed with police in northern Italy, as demonstrations erupted across the country Monday night over government restrictions aimed at quelling a second wave of Covid-19.

Police said around 2,500 people turned out in the city of Turin in two separate groups: one including traders, restaurateurs and small business owners who protested peacefully, the other including extreme fans of the soccer clubs Juventus and Torino. Many had criminal records, police said.

Both Torino and Juventus declined to comment.

Dozens of people, including 10 police officers, were wounded in the clashes as the violent protesters threw stones, firecrackers and bottles at police, and set garbage bins alight. Officers responded with tear gas and arrested 10 people.

A group of ""hooded men"" also smashed shop windows and looted luxury boutiques, including Gucci and Louis Vuitton stores.

Brian May rushed to hospital after heart attack; Queen guitarist had 3 blocked arteries,2020-05-25 00:00:00,"London (CNN) Queen guitarist Brian May has revealed that he was rushed to the hospital by his doctor after suffering a heart attack.

In a video posted to Instagram on Monday, May revealed that in addition to injuring his buttocks in a gardening incident earlier this month, he had also recently suffered from serious heart problems that he believed he ""could have died"" from.

The 72-year-old musician described the ""saga"" of incidents that had befallen him in May, starting with injuring his buttocks.

""I had an MRI and yes I did have a rip in my...my gluteus maximus,"" he said in a video Monday, noting that he assumed the injury was the cause of the pain he was feeling.

However, a week later, the rocker said he was still in ""agony,"" leading him to have an MRI of his spine, which revealed a compressed sciatic nerve."
Prime Minister Modi is a year into his second term. He's still the only game in town for India,2020-05-30 00:00:00,"(CNN) It's been a year since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in for a second term after securing a crushing victory, becoming the country's first leader since the 1970s to do so with a clear parliamentary majority.

During his campaign, Modi faced questions about India's mixed economic performance in the previous five years, but he won over voters with promises to shore up national security and by pushing a Hindu nationalist agenda.

In the past six months, he's faced two significant challenges: nationwide protests over a controversial citizenship law, which led to violent attacks on Muslims, and the threat of thousands of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic.

His handling of the latter has earned praised at home and abroad. But the biggest test is arguably to come -- reopening the country while keeping its 1.3 billion people safe.

Here are five things we've learned about the Indian leader during the past year.

Element of surprise: a Modi hallmark

At 8 p.m. on March 24, Modi gave just four hours' notice of a nationwide coronavirus lockdown , sending millions of people scrambling for groceries, medicines and other essentials.

Perhaps worst affected were the millions of migrant workers who travel from rural areas to work in cities each year. In the lockdown, work suddenly dried up, leaving many of them stranded without pay. Many were forced to walk vast distances due to the public transport shutdown -- and not all of them made it.

Modi's sudden decision -- accompanied by poor planning and execution -- left local administrations confused over what was and wasn't allowed, such as exemptions for online grocery deliveries amid the halt on all e-commerce operations.

""This is a part of his governing style and it can work during normal times but it's not a good way to operate in a time of crisis where you throw surprises at 1.3 billion people,"" said Vivek Dehejia, a professor of economics at Carleton University in Ottawa.

This, of course, was not the first time Modi has made a snap announcement. On November 8, 2016, Modi declared 500 rupee ($7.50) and 1,000 rupee ($15) notes worthless, which made up about 86% of the cash in circulation, in a bid to switch the country to digital payments to stop corruption and tax evasion.

""In each case, there was a four-hour window for people to react and absolute pandemonium broke out,"" said Dehejia.

The result was massive lines at banks, change was nearly impossible to find, and some businesses resorted to barter, with India's poor and most vulnerable bearing the biggest impact. People in remote places missed the window to exchange years' worth of savings in old currency notes.

""You need to think about the consequences and how this will impact millions of people,"" said Meghnad S, an associate editor for Newslaundry, an independent online news outlet.

Distracting from the economy

""Good days are coming,"" was Modi's campaign slogan, as he secured his first term in 2014 on the back of grand plans for the country's economy.

But the lacklustre figures had little bearing on the 2019 election results, which saw Modi return to power with a bigger mandate.

India's unemployment rate hit 8.75% in March, up from 7.03% in May last year -- and is even higher after the coronavirus shutdown.

Furthermore, during his term, his government has committed funds to vanity projects, such as the world's tallest statue or bullet trains , when priorities such as healthcare, infrastructure and sanitation persist.

And with the economic destruction wreaked by the pandemic things are unlikely to improve.

As the country nears the end of a near 10-week lockdown, as of Friday, India had more than 165,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 4,700 deaths.

A senior citizen watches Modi address the nation on a television broadcast during India's government-imposed coronavirus lockdown.

In his last national address on May 12, Modi announced an additional financial package to help the economy.

The new stimulus package, along with previous measures taken by the Indian government, would account for about $266 billion, which is around 10% of the country's GDP, according to Modi.

His government later said this would include $40 billion to help small businesses affected by the outbreak, $20 billion to strengthen the agricultural industry and $5 billion for migrant workers and small-scale farmers.

Furthemore, for many Modi's demonetization strategy built a narrative that he is a strongman who took on black money, and therefore has taken successful economic action.

""Despite the amount of pain caused, a lot of people still love the fact he did something like that,"" says Vivek Kaul, an economic commentator and author. ""If the idea was to get black money out, there are lots of ways to do that, but that would have involved a lot of work.""

Promoting Brand India

Modi is renowned as a master of public relations.

He's become known for his bear hug-embraces of world leaders, while his slogan ""Make in India"" signaled his intention to rebrand the country as the world's next manufacturing hub. In February, he packed the world's largest cricket stadium for a rousing welcome rally for the US President Donald Trump, taglined ""Namaste Trump.""

Modi's flair for PR has been evident during the pandemic, with India promoting its role as a global leader in pharmaceuticals.

A number of world leaders lined up to thank India for its work supplying generic drugs like hydroxychloroquine to meet a rise in demand during the pandemic -- including President Trump.

""Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten!"" Trump tweeted.

Modi responded : ""Times like these bring friends closer. The India-US partnership is stronger than ever ... We shall win this together."" Medical journal The Lancet has since reported that Covid-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine are more likely to die or develop dangerous irregular heart rhythms.

Modi also heavily promoted the country's decision to fly 20,000 citizens home from foreign countries during the pandemic. According to Meghnad, from Newslaundry, it was an example of Modi's external PR efforts to present India's success to the world -- internal migrants' troubles during the lockdown received much less attention.

Dehejia believes there is ""a huge cognitive gap between the rhetoric and the reality"" of Modi's vision of India as a growing economy and an important player in international affairs, after recent events dented the country's soft power and image as a vibrant democracy.

""This was well before the (coronavirus) crisis when anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protests were taking off. That was not good for India's brand as a liberal democracy. The migrant crisis has further damaged the brand,"" says Dehejia.

Marginalizing Muslims

Modi has not been shy about his pro-Hindu religious policies and has lived up to pledges made on the campaign trail.

Last August, he made the surprise decision to scrap a constitutional provision that granted Jammu and Kashmir relative autonomy, which sent the region into turmoil and saw tens of thousands of new troops deployed.

Then in November, his government granted Hindus permission to build a temple at the centuries-old Ayodhya holy site, previously claimed by Hindus and Muslims. The next month, India passed a bill to give Indian citizenship to immigrants from three neighboring countries -- but not if they are Muslim.

Activists stage a candlelight vigil ahead of the Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhyas Ram Janmabhoomi case, in Bangalore on November 7, 2019.

The pandemic has provided more opportunity to marginalize Muslims, after a March gathering in New Delhi of the Tablighi Jamaat, a conservative Muslim missionary group, resulted in a large cluster of cases.

Reports of Islamophobic attacks, both online and on the streets, began to surface, with Muslims being accused of spreading the virus.

Some members of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) began comparing the incident to terrorism.

On Twitter, the head of the BJP's information and technology unit, Amit Malviya, called the gathering part of an ""Islamic insurrection"" while Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the BJP's Minister for Minority Affairs accused the event organizers of a ""Talibani crime.""

Like previous incidents, most recently seen in February when violent communal clashes broke out in the capital New Delhi, the government failed to take stringent action.

""Modi did put out a tweet on harmony but it felt like an afterthought. There's a lack of communication and it's more obvious because otherwise he tweets about everything under the sun,"" said Meghnad, from Newslaundry.

""Obviously, they (Tablighi Jamaat) are at fault and action should be taken but to paint an entire community and the conflation of the actions of a few is ridiculous. The government should actively come out but they let it turn into the monster that it did,"" he added.

Priorities on spending

While Modi's government has announced $266 billion in relief packages during the pandemic, Dehejia, from Carleton University, points out that much of what was announced in a week-long series of press conferences by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had already been committed.

""Part of the Modi government brand has been to make these big announcements over things that they've already been doing or what previous governments have done and brand it as a new package ... The amount of new money committed is essentially quite small,"" he said.

Sitharaman's penultimate press conference highlighting reforms to sectors such as mining, defense and the country's space program raised eyebrows over the relevance of the announcement during the current situation.

""Tone-deaf is the only charitable explanation,"" said Dehejia. Many felt more should have been invested in the country's creaking healthcare infrastructure, which has been an issue regardless of the party in power.

According to the World Bank, in 2017, India allocated around 3.5% of its GDP towards health. This compares to the United States, which spent 17% of its GDP on healthcare and poorer nations such as Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, which set aside 13.4% and 12% respectively in the same year.

Looking ahead, spending wisely and investing in the right parts of the economy will be crucial -- though experts say Modi has such a strong mandate that he's essentially free to do what he wants.

And India's next election isn't due until 2024.

The bigger issue is the lack of credible opposition. The 2019 election dealt a sharp blow to the India's main opposition Congress party, which won just 52 seats compared to the BJP's 303. To win, a party needs 272 elected seats out of 543.

The result marked the Congress party's second-worst showing ever in a general election.

""A crisis of any kind greatly empowers the incumbent. Whether it's Trump's nightly news conferences or Boris Johnson's or Modi's announcements, that's what's visible to the public and opposition parties struggle to make an impact or appear on the evening news,"" said Dehejia.

""What is the credible alternative at the national level? Modi's the only game in town for India."""

Prison set on fire in Nigeria as protest death toll rises to at least 56,2020-10-22 00:00:00,"(CNN) At least 56 people have died across Nigeria since the #EndSARS protests began on October 8, with 38 killed across the country on Tuesday alone, according to human rights group Amnesty International.

Unrest continued on Thursday when gunshots rang out in the affluent Ikoyi neighborhood of Lagos, an eyewitness told CNN. Adukeo Ogundiya, a 22-year-old staying at a hotel opposite the Ikoyi correctional facility, said she saw fire and smoke coming out of the prison.

""I saw people jumping out and the fire is getting really crazy, everywhere the clouds were dark,"" she told CNN. ""Then for [sic] next 30 minutes there were [sic] shooting, they opened fire, just shooting.""

Ogundiya said she wasn't sure who was shooting, and saw people in plain clothes jumping over fences.

Military personnel were deployed and all roads leading to the prison are blocked. A police officer at one road block confirmed to CNN that the fire may have been started by someone inside the prison.

A witness living near the prison, Foluke Dede, told CNN a crowd had gathered at the prison and set offices ablaze before the police and army arrived. ""We saw some of the prisoners try to break through a wall to the right side of the prison,"" she said.

There are also reports of a warehouse containing food and medical supplies in Lagos being ransacked. Videos showed hundreds of people inside the warehouse, which held coronavirus relief supplies, carrying away whatever they could.

Multiple eyewitnesses and Amnesty International told CNN that at least 12 demonstrators had been shot dead at Lekki toll gate and another site on Tuesday by Army soldiers, who then took the bodies away.

In a televised address on Thursday evening, President Muhammadu Buhari urged protestors to take advantage of the reforms that the government was implementing, and ""resist the temptation of being used by some subversive elements to cause chaos.""

The president called on Nigerian ""youths to discontinue the street protests and constructively engage government in finding solutions. Your voice has been heard loud and clear and we are responding.""

Nigerians had called on President Muhammadu Buhari to apologize for the onslaught. Before Thursday's address, he had only asked for ""understanding and calm"" in a statement issued on Wednesday and signed by his special adviser Femi Adesina, which did not mention the attacks.

""I don't even know how I feel, I want the president to say sorry,"" Wofai Fada, a Nigerian actor, told CNN. ""He must tell us something, ask for time or something, you'll make it up to us.""

Fada said she would go out to protest again, even though she is scared, because ""this is more than police brutality, this is about transformation.""

""We don't have jobs, university graduates are bus conductors. We need reform but please don't kill us.""

Eyewitnesses say the army barricaded the protesters at Lekki and refused to allow ambulances through.

Darlington, a 23-year-old who spoke to CNN on condition that only his first name was used, said he saw many victims being shot.

""I was not injured but I was stained in blood, stained in the victims' blood,"" he told CNN. ""Then some kind-hearted Nigerians sent down some paramedics and ambulances but the army barricaded them and stopped them getting through the toll gate.""

Idea Chukwuma Innocent was at the protest when shooting started. He told CNN that when ambulances weren't allowed through he transported 12 people to two different hospitals in his car and donated blood with his brother.

""I couldn't help the dead people, but I could help the injured,"" he said. ""I saw some bodies on the floor, I'm not going to lie about that. I saw some people who were dead and I saw some people who were still alive but struggling.""

He said the protests were calm and peaceful before the attack, with young Nigerians waving flags and singing songs.

Multiple witnesses told CNN they saw the army take the bodies away.

The Nigerian army claimed on Twitter that these reports were ""fake news."" The Nigerian Army and police did not return requests for comment.

Several witnesses and Amnesty said CCTV camera were removed by government officials and the electricity was cut, which Amnesty said was ""a clear attempt to hide evidence.""

The governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said nobody ordered the removal of cameras at the Lekki tollgate.

""The managing director of the Lekki Conservation Centre said because of the curfew, they made the decision to take out installations,"" he told Arise TV in an interview on Thursday. ""The cameras you saw are not security or motion cameras, they are laser cameras for vehicles.""

Violence was also reported by eyewitnesses and Amnesty in other parts of the city.

Raheem Olanrewaju spoke to CNN from his home at Herbert Macauley Way, in Ebute Metta, about 14km (9 miles) from the Lekki toll gate and woke up to gunshots on Wednesday.

""A fight broke out in my area between police and thugs,"" he told CNN. ""This led to direct shootings at the thugs.""

Amnesty said the killings took place in Lekki and Alausa, a district further north and which is the seat of power in Lagos. Eyewitnesses at the Alausa protest ground told the human rights group they were attacked by a team of soldiers and policemen from the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) Unit at about 8 p.m. local time, leaving at least two people dead and one critically injured.

""Soldiers clearly had one intention -- to kill without consequences,"" said the country director of Amnesty International, Osai Ojigho, in a statement on Wednesday.

Protests against police brutality following the attacks on Tuesday took place across the world.

In London a couple of hundred people gathered outside the Nigerian High Commission building on Wednesday, waving placards saying EndSARS and leading chants of ""Buhari must go.""

""He [Buhari] has created the greatest atrocity,"" said Oyedoyin Olajide, a 34-year-old from Camberwell, south London, who works in education. ""No one has massacred the youth of Nigeria like this.""

In the United States, between 150 and 200 people walked peacefully from the Consulate General of Nigeria in Midtown Manhattan toward the United Nations building, said Shola Tijani, a student in New York who was at the protest.

""It's paramount for Nigerians to raise awareness as the government have failed its people and turned [sic] murderers,"" he said.

Videos on social media show demonstrations taking place in other African countries like South Africa, Kenya and Ghana.

The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, called for an end to the brutality and abuse on Wednesday.

""The Secretary-General urges the security forces to act at all times with maximum restraint while calling on protestors to demonstrate peacefully and to refrain from violence,"" said his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, in a statement.

He joined a chorus of international voices which included US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this country strongly condemns the use of excessive force by military forces and welcomes an immediate investigation.

""We call on the security services to show maximum restraint and respect fundamental rights and for demonstrators to remain peaceful.,"" he said in a statement on Thursday."
"SARS: Nigerian youth, celebrities protest against controversial police unit accused of brutality",2020-10-09 00:00:00,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigeria's leading celebrities and activists have organized mass protests across major cities in the country Friday demanding an end to police brutality in the country.

The nationwide protests were a culmination of weeks of anger and outcry online by the country's young people over claims of kidnapping, harassment and extortion by a police unit known as the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS).

On Thursday, a protest was led in Lagos Island by Folarin Falana, a lawyer and singer, and Runtown, an artist known by that stage name.

Falana, who is popularly known as Falz, told CNN it was important for him to march because there have been ""too many numerous incidents of harassment, extortion and police brutality,"" in the country. He added that he, too, had been a victim of harassment at the hands of the Nigerian police.

Tomorrow morning we move out for the #EndSARSprotest ! We are not out to cause trouble, but our voices must be heard! 10am we link up at the Lekki toll gate. #EndSars

""People have been posting online about it for years, but it has been the same sluggish attitude and response to it. Nothing has changed and people keep on being harassed. That's why we have taken to the streets and we want the government to listen,"" he said.

""I am marching for the ones that are not recognized. We are surprised by the numbers that came out and we are prepared to march again,"" he added.

Protests continue into the night

Overnight protests were also held in Lagos mainland Thursday outside the Lagos State Assembly as organizers carried placards and knelt down, chanting 'End SARS .'

A group of protesters, led by Debo Adebayo, a comedian by the stage name of Mr Macaroni, held a protest vigil , running into the third night in a row, in Alausa, Lagos.

Videos from the protesters shared on Twitter Thursday night showed police officers forcefully dispersing the protesters, dismantling their sleeping tents, turning off the street lights and making verbal threats.

Nigeria's police force had responded to the public outcry last Sunday by banning the unit from carrying out any stop-and-search activities.

SARS, as well as other tactical police units, are now prohibited from ""carrying out routine patrols and other conventional low-risk. duties -- stop and search duties, checkpoints, mounting of roadblocks, traffic checks, etc -- with immediate effect,"" Nigeria police chief Mohammed Adamu said on Sunday in a statement.

""Voices and complaints on the issues of unprofessional conducts by some SARS operatives have been heard very loudly and clearly,"" the statement read.

Feyikemi Abudu was among the protesters outside the Lagos State Assembly in Ikeja on Friday. She told CNN their demands were presented to the assembly, which held an emergency session Friday to listen to their demands.

""There are many demands, but the main one is to scrap SARS, not to reform it but to completely end it. Another demand is compensation for victims of SARS brutality, both alive and dead. We also want a committee that will investigate and look into the present and past grievances around SARS brutality, "" Abudu said.

Abudu also told CNN she has raised 1.3 million naira (about $3,390) to buy food for those protesting and for medical treatment for those injured during the protests.

Media personality Toke Makinwa was also among those who protested. ""People are constantly calling my show with reports of harassment,"" she said.

""One man told me they pulled his phone and searched his banking app, they took him to an ATM to withdraw money for them. Nigeria has reduced its citizens to doing everything by themselves. SARS should not be one of the problems we have to face. You are supposed to be anti-robbery but we are afraid of you. People who are meant to protect are the ones oppressing us.""

CNN put this and other allegations to the Nigerian police force, and Lagos state spokesman Muyiwa Adejobi said that all complaints against its officers are carefully investigated and appropriate sanctions applied to offenders.

Adejobi added that many people rarely report the abuses because they fear that they may not get justice. He encouraged people affected by police misconduct to report the abuses.

'A lack of political will'

The police say that the ban on the SARS unit is one of many steps towards reforming the outfit.

However, this ban is not the first time authorities in Nigeria have censured the SARS unit.

In 2018, the country's Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo , while deputizing for the President who was out of the country on vacation at the time, ordered the unit to be overhauled. In January 2019, the police announced another ban on the same police unit.

But the human rights organization Amnesty Nigeria says not much has changed since these bans were put in place.

""A similar ban on SARS did not end police brutality because it appeared the bans were simply done to assuage the swelling public anger at the time of the announcement and not intended to end police brutality,"" Amnesty Nigeria's program manager, Seun Bakare, said.

In an email to CNN, he said as a result of past campaigns, some reforms like ""the passage of the anti-torture act 2017, the signing of the new police act"" and other minor amendments have been passed.

The anti-torture act of 2017, for example, is supposed to protect Nigerians, including suspects and detainees from torture and inhumane treatment. However, there seems to be a lack of political will to enforce these laws, Bakare said.

'Nothing will happen if I shoot you,'

The hashtag #EndSARS, #StopPolicebrutality has continued to trend on Twitter as young people shared their stories, photos and videos that they allege show men in Nigeria police uniforms searching their cars and harassing them.

Lagos-based entrepreneur Samuel Otigba told CNN he has had several encounters with members of the police that he believes to be from the SARS unit. He said the encounters usually begin with requests for bribes. Otigba alleges that in May, he got into trouble because he declined to give a bribe to one of the officers when he was stopped after an evening out with his wife.

He says his phone was searched and he was threatened by the officer who told him, ""You know if I shoot you, nothing will happen. The highest anyone will do is cry justice on Twitter.""

Otigba recounted another encounter earlier this year when another set of officers, who were wearing masks, he said, stopped him and his wife again after a night out in Lagos state.

""Six of them jumped out of their mini bus and started pointing guns at us, commanding us to get out of our car. We thought they were armed robbers. We were all so scared and my wife was crying,"" Otigba told CNN.

This time he says he paid the officers 20,000 naira (around $52) before they were let go. He said he did not report the incident.

Adejobi, the police spokesman, said only incidents that are reported are investigated.

'Carrying laptops not a crime'

Many tech entrepreneurs say they are targeted for having things like tattoos and dreadlocks, or simply for carrying laptops and smartphones.

Between 2017 and 2020, Amnesty International said it has documented 82 cases of police brutality in Nigeria.

""Detainees in SARS custody have been subjected to a variety of methods of torture including hanging, mock execution, beating, punching and kicking, burning with cigarettes, waterboarding, near-asphyxiation with plastic bags, forcing detainees to assume stressful bodily positions and sexual violence,"" Amnesty's report said.

Nigeria police chief Mohammed Adamu warned against ""the invasion of the privacy of citizens particularly through indiscriminate and unauthorized search of mobile phones, laptops, and other smart devices,"" while Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osinbajo recently held a meeting with police chiefs over the issue, according to a statement from the Presidency.

Osinbajo said the president is ""very concerned about it, and ... wants to see reform.""

""You cannot have a situation where SARS says they are investigating cybercrime by arresting young men and women carrying their laptops and phones. I don't see how you can investigate that by seizing people's phones in a taxi or in their cars,"" according to tweets attributed to Osinbajo."
The World Trade Organization should enforce its own rules (opinion),2019-10-10 00:00:00,"Chuck Grassley, a Republican, is a United States senator from Iowa andchairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, is a United States senator from Oregon and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.

With the World Trade Organization Public Forum underway in Geneva, it is time for members to confront and address the problems that are eroding the WTO's credibility and effectiveness. These are problems that, if left unresolved, will endanger the WTO's future relevance.

Today, the WTO is where nations negotiate the rules for international trade and resolve disputes that arise when a trading partner believes the rules aren't being followed. This trading system has been critical to helping reduce global poverty rates, which have shrunk even while the global population has expanded.

We support the WTO's mission, but we are growing frustrated that the institution is not fully and effectively performing its intended functions.

First, while the WTO was intended to be a forum for multilateral trade negotiations, it has proven difficult to come to agreements that give a fair shot to all nations, not just wealthier countries that can subsidize their industries.

In addition, some WTO members that have advanced economies are claiming ""developing country status"" in order to avoid their trade obligations. For years, economic powerhouses, like China, have relied on this self-designation to shirk WTO commitments in critical areas such as agriculture and illegal subsidies. This hinders progress for members that want to expand trade and commerce and undermines the integrity of the WTO itself. This is why we support the US proposal to change the way the WTO treats developing countries, which is targeted at strengthening the negotiating function of the organization.

Still, two ongoing projects offer the WTO a chance to get it right. Negotiations are underway to curtail the fish subsidies that have long promoted overfishing and unfair competition and to decrease barriers to e-commerce and digitally-supported trade. If concluded, these agreements would demonstrate that the WTO can still serve as the institution it was intended to be.

Second, while the WTO serves as a forum to settle disputes among its members, we have serious concerns about the degree to which the system is working. The Appellate Body -- the quasi-judicial review forum used to take a second look into dispute decisions -- has long strayed off course from its original form and function. Our concerns about systemic and procedural problems with the Appellate Body are not new, nor are they partisan. US presidents on both sides of the aisle have taken issue with Appellate Body members addressing issues that were not raised by the parties to involved in the dispute, taking longer than 90 days to decide appeals, and creating new rights and obligations for WTO members -- all against the terms of the Dispute Settlement Understanding

We see great value in having an institution like the Appellate Body that ensures dispute panels faithfully apply the rules to which we all agreed. However, the Appellate Body also needs to operate as the members agreed.

Lastly, the WTO must improve its ability to monitor member states' trade policies and practices. Some WTO members, like China, consistently fail to meet their obligations to accurately report the subsidies they provide to domestic industries. In other cases, members have failed to disclose measures that affect international trade, such as India's ban on US agricultural products for alleged safety concerns, which the WTO ultimately found to be disguised protectionism, or China's various cybersecurity requirements on information and communication technology.

This is unacceptable. A number of countries regularly take advantage of other WTO members that comply with notification and transparency rules while ignoring their own obligations. The United States has advocated for measures that would incentivize the member states to abide by the rules by providing for consequences in cases of noncompliance, such as loss of privileges to chair WTO bodies.

Undoubtedly, there is a lot of work to do to fix these problems. The United States has long been a leader on these issues, but we can't do it alone.

The United States, Japan and the European Union have been discussing WTO reforms. Partnerships like this are essential to showing member states who consistently break the rules that their actions won't be tolerated. We encourage and welcome others to join us in these efforts.

The Bretton Woods experiment following World War II, which established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) alongside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and the resulting creation of the WTO nearly half a century later, wasn't just about advancing US interests alone, it was about advancing our collective interests. For the WTO to succeed in this mission, its members must acknowledge its shortcomings -- particularly when it comes to enforcing or negotiating rules to confront unfair trade practices -- and work toward solutions to fix them."

Turns out he is equally adept on the fairways and greens as he is on clay, grass and hard courts.

Playing against 59 other golfers, most of whom were professional players, the 34-year-old Nadal finished nine over par after a final round 77, meaning he was tied for sixth position.

The Mallorcan finished 10 shots behind eventual winner Sebastian Garcia, who finished one under par to take home the title.

Tiger Woods and Justin Thomas win mic'd up tournament,2020-09-23 00:00:00,"(CNN) Who knew Rory McIlroy was such a fan of Domino's pizza and that Justin Thomas was the king of trash talk?

During the Payne's Valley Cup -- a Ryder Cup-style tournament where players are fitted with microphones for fans to listen in -- McIlroy declared his love for the pizza chain, much to the amusement of Thomas.

We also found out that Thomas struggles to sleep with a stuffed raccoon starring at him. Justin Rose quipped he had a similar problem but with pictures of Tiger Woods . That brought a huge grin to Woods' face.

The four were competing in the Team US vs. Team Europe exhibition match to mark the opening Payne's Valley Golf Course at Big Cedar Lodge in Ridgedale, Missouri -- the first public golf course designed by Woods' TGR Design firm.

Woods and Thomas represented the US, while McIlroy and Rose featured for Europe.

All four competitors have been world No. 1s, are major champions, have won the FedExCup and have been part of victorious Ryder Cup teams.

""You hate to see that.""

The teams competed over 19 holes and three different formats -- six holes of four-ball, six of alternate shots and seven of singles play. Team Europe won the first point after six holes of foursomes, but Team US won one point themselves in the alternate shot format, with Rose then beating Woods and Thomas defeating McIlroy in the singles.

The 19th bonus hole doubled up as a closest-to-the-pin decider to settle the contest -- with two all-time greats, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, also playing -- after it finished in a 2-2- draw. Thomas hit the closest tee shot to secure the victory for Team US.

And while fans tuned in to see some excellent golf, it turned out to be the conversations and joking between the players that stole the show.

After learning about Thomas and Rose's struggles to sleep, viewers were treated to the players ribbing each other when one made a mistake -- led by Thomas -- and learning about McIlroy's pizza passion.

After Rose hooked a drive way off to the left on the third hole, 2017 PGA Championship winner Thomas could be heard saying: ""That's got to be 150 yards off line.""

Later on the 14th, after a putt from McIlroy clipped the lip but agonizingly rolled out, Thomas consolidated the Northern Irishman, saying: ""You hate to see it.""

McIlroy did bite back later, saying he was supposed to give Thomas a lift home, but if he kept on talking, that might change.

Thomas also complained about Woods having his name on their shared ball, referring to the 15-time major winner as ""dumb-dumb.""

It wasn't all trash talk between the group though. Fans were given an insight into the level of detail players go into when they prepare their game.

On the very first hole, Woods and Rose could be heard discussing about shafts and backswings. McIlroy explained to Rose and Thomas how his new hybrid club spins less than the other ones he tried.

And while it was good to see the professionals relax, the PGA Tour season soon ramps up, with the CJ Cup -- where Thomas is the reigning champion -- and the Zozo Championship -- Woods won in 2019 -- taking place in October before the rescheduled Masters in November."
Ryder Cup: The inside story of golf's biggest postponement,2020-09-26 00:00:00,"(CNN) September's final weekend in 2020 had been locked in sports fans' diaries ever since the final putt at Le Golf National in France in 2018: the return of golf's greatest spectacle.

A weekend where the drive for individual glory gives way to a need to succeed for the team. Where suddenly any concern over prize money or world ranking is forgone for the sheer pride of representing your country, or your continent.

It was meant to be the weekend of the 43rd Ryder Cup, fought between Team USA and Team Europe. But it isn't.

A sporting event's cancellation -- or in this case, postponement -- is nothing new in 2020, a year in which virtually every tournament, league, and village table tennis championship has been affected in one way or another by Covid-19.

But sitting where it did in the calendar, in late September, for a while it seemed some small tweaks to the format might allow the Ryder Cup to go ahead.

""Things started coming to a head in March when they started closing down the tours,"" Team Europe's captain, Padraig Harrington, told CNN's Living Golf.

Padraig Harrington competed in six Ryder Cups as a player, winning four of them.

""At that stage we started making all sorts of alternative options, what we'd do with picking the team, how we get in the right amount of play, and just making all different scenarios for selection, qualification, picks, timings, all that.""

But as the pandemic spread and the early optimism over fans returning to the grandstands faded, hope quickly diminished and in July, the decision was announced that Whistling Straits -- the Wisconsin course hosting the event -- would have to wait another year, as the Ryder Cup was postponed until September 2021.

No fans, no Ryder Cup

With the PGA Tour resuming in June, and the European Tour following suit in July, it was clear that golf could still go ahead in pandemic conditions. But for the Ryder Cup, it wasn't as simple as just playing behind closed doors.

The organizers and players knew this was a tournament that needed fans.

In July, European Tour CEO Keith Pelley told CNN: ""If you couldn't guarantee 15 or 20,000 fans, then the Ryder Cup is not the Ryder Cup. It is tribal in nature. And that first tee experience is the best experience in golf undeniably. If you couldn't have that, would that be detrimental to the Ryder Cup? I personally felt it would.""

Throughout the lengthy decision-making process, Pelley was in near-daily contact with his counterpart Jay Monahan, Commissioner of the PGA Tour, but also with some of Team Europe's star players.

""I remember saying to Rory [McIlroy], 'Who are you going to raise your hands to? Patrick Reed's caddy? Who's Patrick going to shush? The marshal?' That's the magic of the Ryder Cup.""

Having played in six Ryder Cups between 1999 and 2010, Harrington understands the importance of the crowd to the event.

""The buzz, the excitement, the pressure, the stress. Everything that the crowd brings to it, it just lifts you up during the week. I don't think it would be a Ryder Cup without it.""

The impact of a fanless tournament would have stretched beyond the course.

The 2018 match at Le Golf National in Paris attracted 270,000 fans over the course of the Ryder Cup Weekend -- an injection of $278 million to the French economy, according to a study by Sheffield Hallam University.

Fans pack the grandstand at Le Golf National in Paris to witness Team Europe's victory in 2018.

But even more lucrative are the global TV deals. ""TV doesn't want to house the event unless it's top class TV,"" Harrington explained.

""They don't want to host sporting events with shallow ratings, they want the good ratings so they knew they needed spectators.""

The knock-on impact of postponement

With its postponement, the Ryder Cup returns to its biennial spot in odd-numbered years.

From 1947 to 1999, this was its traditional spot in the calendar, but after the grounding of flights in the wake of 9/11, the 2001 Ryder Cup at The Belfry in England was postponed to the following year.

Since then the Ryder Cup has taken place in even-numbered years, with the Presidents Cup -- Team USA's alternate biennial match against a 'rest of the world apart from Europe' side -- taking place in the odd years.

For Pelley, the realignment of the traditional 'cup years' is one of the silver linings to the postponement.

""You can look at it and say, 'Oh, my word, that's incredibly detrimental to your business. How are you going to be able to survive financially?' But you can also look at it completely differently and go, 'Oh, it's a great positive. It gets us back onto the rotation that we always wanted with the odd years.'""

The move knocks the Presidents Cup back into even years, and also gives Europe an extra year to prepare the Marco Simone course in Rome for hosting the 2023 Ryder Cup.

The 2023 Ryder Cup at the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club will be the first time the tournament has been played in Italy.

""I'm not saying it wouldn't have been ready for 2022,"" Pelley explained. ""But one more year to get an Italian Open and for Marco Simone to mature as a golf course is a significant advantage for us.""

As for the captains -- and in turn the players -- one more year to wait could have a sizable impact on who gets selected for each team.

While some players seem nailed on for a spot in the tournament -- the likes of Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm for Team Europe and Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau for Team USA -- there are 12 places to fill for each team, and an extra year is sure to see some changes in who makes the cut.

From a European perspective, Harrington admits he already has his eye on some younger candidates for next September.

""It actually gives some time to some young kids to make the '21 team,"" he says. ""The Hojgaard twins, they're only 18, they were too young this year, but next year? Sam Horsfield is obviously coming to play.

Danish twin brothers Rasmus and Nicolai Hojgaard played together in the 2018 Junior Ryder Cup.

""It gives the younger players a chance to play their way in, which is obviously a little tough on the older guys because they're a year older. But things will change by 2021.""

It may prove vital for Team Europe that things do change. With eight of the world's current top 10 players coming from the US, Europe will have their work cut out if they are to claim victory on American soil.

While the 12-month grace period can't guarantee that fans will be able to attend the tournament at Whistling Straits, it at least facilitates the possibility -- and as all the organizers agree, a Ryder Cup is no Ryder Cup without fans.

""I think it was the right choice,"" Harrington concludes. ""Hopefully next year we'll be in a lot better place."""
"Mikaela Shiffrin wins reindeer, names it Ingemar",2019-11-25 00:00:00,"(CNN) She won a reindeer and named it Ingemar.

Mikaela Shiffrin's unusual prize was for winning a World Cup slalom race in Levi, Finland Saturday, but as the 41st slalom title of her glittering career it took her past the record of Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark in skiing's most technical discipline.

Nice to meet you, Ingemar 💛 • • •

I was thinking about this name yesterday after the race when someone mentioned the record, but there were a couple things to sort through before announcing it. First was to ask for Ingemar's permission of course! (Cont. in comments⤵️) pic.twitter.com/UQ66fjFZfV — Mikaela Shiffrin (@MikaelaShiffrin) November 24, 2019

The American, who has become the standout star in the sport, said the name she gave to the reindeer -- her fourth from Levi -- was a tribute to one of the ""greatest skiers ever.""

""There were a couple of things to sort out before announcing it. First was to ask for Ingemar's permission of course,"" the 24-year-old American wrote in a series of Twitter posts

""And now I have this record to my name -- a milestone that I never in my wildest dreams thought I would achieve when I was younger -- but all I could think was, Ingemar was better. I don't see it as 'breaking his record,' I am just continuing it.

Patrick Mahomes breaks NFL touchdown pass record as the Kansas City Chiefs bounce back to win,2020-10-20 00:00:00,"(CNN) And just like that Patrick Mahomes broke a NFL touchdown pass record as the Kansas City Chiefs got back to winning ways against the Buffalo Bills.

The quarterback threw two touchdown passes to inspire the Chiefs to a 26-17 win on Monday as they bounced back from a disappointing loss to the Las Vegas Raiders last time out.

With his first touchdown pass of the night, Mahomes became the fastest player in the Super Bowl era to reach 90 touchdown passes, doing so in just 37 games. The previous mark was set by Hall of Famer Dan Marino, who reached the landmark in 40 games.

Travis Kelce received both of Mahomes' touchdown passes as the quarterback recorded a touchdown pass in his 16th consecutive game.

New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees leads the NFL all-time passing touchdown list with 556 passes.
