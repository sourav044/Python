What living looks like in a pandemized world,2020-10-26 00:00:00,"Living in a world with the coronavirus pandemic has become the new normal. It has impacted almost every aspect of human life and society, and its long-term impact is yet to be fully measured. While its impact in terms of loss of life, job loss, shrinking economy, travel ban, etc. is clearly visible and devastating, its impact on human psychology, physiology and genetic map, intergroup relations, and national and international politics are yet to be studied.

The onslaught of the virus and its capability to challenge human life is compared to a real war. This war is not between groups or states, but between the virus and the human individual and society. The virus challenged both the mightiest nations and the poorest nations. The leaders seemed to be clueless as to how to tackle this virus. It is not uncommon to come across refrain from the leaders that this invisible enemy is not under their control. The powerful countries are as powerless as poor countries. In this deadly war, the enemy is invisible hence military power is of no use. The weapons are masks, social distancing, self-quarantine, and other such measures. Everybody is waiting for the vaccine, which is yet elusive.

The psychological impact of the pandemic is far reaching. There are reports that drug abuse, domestic violence, and suicide are rising because of the loss of dear ones, lack of freedom and mobility, home confinement, and economic hardship. Living life virtually for a long time is indeed difficult. One can imagine the situation in which the sole bread earner of the family or a dear one succumbs to the virus. Those who tested positive or lost dear ones find it difficult to focus on their work. Though social media provides means of communication and helps channel some feelings, it is in no way a substitute for physical interaction. The Internet does not give the sense of touch, the feeling of closeness, or the excitement that a sight of a loved one brings.

The pandemic has forced people to cancel their plans. There are no more get together parties, visiting family members, and travelling far off places during holidays. Market complexes and stores look deserted. Whereas the globalized world, with open borders, increasing means of travel and communication, capitalist market and consumerist culture gravitated towards the building of a global village, the virus challenged it and plunged the whole world into some sort of slumber, where life is not the life the modern individual wanted and cherished. A nine-year old boy, excited about the forthcoming Halloween, told me that whereas earlier kids were using masks and other costumes for the festival, this time it seems everybody, both young and old, are wearing the costumes. Though he indicated the use of masks by people, the allusion to Halloween costumes invokes dreary pictures. In fact, it is difficult to say whether the individual behind the mask is smiling or frowning.

Instead of going to the international politics of the virus and its spread, which is a different subject, it can be safely argued that the virus hampered international trade and economic development. It shrunk the global economy. It disrupted international trade and communication. More so, it dented the idea and practice of free trade and global market. The countries are gravitating more towards regional markets and even domestic markets. And this trend will likely continue for some years. The world will be gravitating more towards isolationism and perhaps parochialism.

But these developments will not entail the end of conflicts, rather it is a possibility, as seen in the context of current India-China border conflict, the conflicts will flare up. The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno Karabakh flared up at the height of this pandemic. The protests against incumbent regimes in Belarus and Thailand took place despite the pandemic. The killing spree in the Af-Pak region and other conflict hotspots is continuing. One can argue that the individual is suffering attacks from both visible and invisible enemies. It is a different subject matter whether the countries are diverting the attention from the domestic issues to the border conflict or some other external issues to pacify domestic unrest. It is possible that some countries are trying to take advantage of other countries which are concentrating on domestic recovery.

Particularly one aspect of politics appears concerning. There is a possibility of rise of authoritarianism, the rise of a police state, and the curtailment of individual freedom. Whereas the ideas and policies like travel ban, quarantine, mask orders make sense to contain the spread of the virus, forceful imposition of these policies, and in some cases imprisonment, fine, and other repressive measures have curtailed basic human rights and shook the foundations of a democratic order. It is true that it is a difficult balance to champion human rights and maintain law and order, but the countries which already lack democratic culture will capitalize on this fragile situation and strengthen authoritarian apparatus.

Though parallels are drawn between the coronavirus and the Spanish flu of the first decades of the 20th century, the key difference is that the flu happened when the world was not as developed as it is today. The idea and practice of a globalized world had not taken roots then. To put it simply, there were no air travels across continents, no internet or cell phones. The virus challenged the developments of the past century. It also punctured the accepted invincibility of human ingenuity and its mastery of nature. It posed some sort of existential threat to human life. Though human ingenuity will finally emerge victorious, it is difficult to predict the future."

Next pandemic : What can insurers do?,2020-10-26 00:00:00,"While the debate on the possible source of COVID-2019 continues – the pandemic shows no signs of an exit. Yet, scientists are already concerned about what could be the next big one. Howsoever distanced insurers may seem, they do have an important role to play. If only they begin to see the dotted line between the climate crisis and the current pandemic, as well as what possibly lies in store.

Next theatre

The Arctic may sound too far flung. However, as the greenhouse gases (GHGs) bake us, the temperature in the Arctic Circle is rising about three times faster than the rest of the globe. With the melting ice sea levels are rising. The permafrost thaw is not just releasing CO2 and methane, ‘Pathogenic viruses that can infect humans or animals might be preserved in old permafrost layers, including some that have caused global epidemics in the past’ could get released, believes eminent evolutionary biologist Jean-Michel Claverie. Smallpox and anthrax are just two known ones, the rest is anybody’s guess.

Moreover, with the Arctic sea ice melting, the north shore of Siberia has become more easily accessible by sea, according to BBC.com. As a result, industrial exploitation, including mining and drilling for oil and natural gas, is now becoming profitable. ‘At the moment, these regions are deserted and the deep permafrost layers are left alone,’ says Claverie. ‘However, these ancient layers could be exposed by the digging involved in mining and drilling operations. If viable virions are still there, this could spell disaster.’ Given the prevalence of natural antibiotic resistance, scientists fear that many of the bacteria emerging from melting permafrost may already have it, according to BBC.com.

How prepared are other countries?

In a brilliant commentary, well known author and former diplomat Ambassador Navtej Sarna red flags the smallpox threat, in particular. ‘The US Strategic National Stockpile contains enough smallpox vaccine for every American. Such preparedness against a deadly disease that was eradicated 40 years ago indicates a threat perception of epidemic proportions’. ‘India stopped smallpox vaccine production in 1979. Approximately 900 million Indians, all those under 40… are unprotected against this disease, should it resurface’ he reminds.

‘Fears of a smallpox outbreak – intentional or accidental – are not entirely unreasonable. Live variola virus stocks are officially held only in two high-security labs – the Vector Institute in Novosibirsk, Russia, and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, US. However, it remains possible that all stocks held by several countries were not destroyed or handed over – the exercise was based only on good faith. The two permitted stockpiles were also slated for early destruction but the decision was kicked down the road; the 2001 anthrax threat and 9/11 went in favour of retention of these stocks to enable better bio-defence. This retention carries the risk of accidental release or deliberate leakage’.

‘Anticipating these threats, several countries have built up national stockpiles of new-generation smallpox vaccines and the US has developed at least two anti-viral drugs. WHO itself has an emergency stockpile of about 33 million doses, the bulk in the form of country pledges, and has developed protocols for dispensing it to affected countries. It is clear that in case of a widespread outbreak, nations will prioritise their stockpiles for their own citizens and the multilateral stock will fall woefully short, especially if the US leaves the World Health Organization’, warns Ambassador Sarna.

Some actionables

Campaigns like Insure Our Future have been vigorously demanding the US insurance industry to stop insuring and investing in fossil fuels. Fossil fuels represent the biggest threat to the rising temperatures and the resulting irreversible damage. Insurers need to urgently overcome their obsession. Likewise, insurers need to particularly resist the temptation of investing in and insuring any economic activity in the fragile ecosystem of the Arctic. More recently climate activists have begun campaigning against the US health industry. Asking them to divest from fossil fuels. ‘It is time for these companies to align their investments with their healing mission,’ a physician with one of the medical environment groups was quoted on twitter by Alan Goforth.

‘This is a good moment for India to review our preparedness: nationally, we should have a large enough smallpox vaccine stockpile, an ability to ramp up production and access to antiviral drugs. On the multilateral front, India needs to lead the efforts, as current chair of the WHO executive board, to ensure equitable access to the vaccine as a public good. After all, the virus stocks were held by Russia and the US not as national materials but in trust for all humanity’, comes the wise counsel from the Ambassador.

When building up a pandemic pool, should not the insurance industry in India also consider building a war chest of smallpox and anthrax vaccine supply for its policyholders – to start with? This is, however, no prescription to shortchange the Climate Change agenda."

Beauty Blogger Applies Henna On Lips,2020-10-26 13:05:50+00:00,"Beauty blogging makes up for a major part of the online world with bloggers showcasing their hacks and tricks for everyone to try out. However, this one has left people, especially Indians, quite baffled as it doesn't really feel right.

A Chicago-based model and a beauty blogger named Brianah Christianson posted a video on TikTok where she was seen using henna as lip colour. Yep, you read that right and now you feel gross.

The same visuals were shared on Twitter she was using a henna cone to put a little bit of it on a bowl and then with the help of a small brush, she was applying it onto her lips. Christianson called it the 'Henna Lip Stain'.

The video was posted on the micro-blogging site by a user named 'Ash.'

As an Indian who has grown up with mehendi being applied to hands on festivals and weddings, and sometimes, even hair, this feels very wrong.

Being a South Asian, the first worry that would cross our mind is, 'Why would anyone want orange-stained lips?' Also, henna comes adulterated with so many chemicals these days, it is not safe at all to apply it anywhere on your face, especially near your mouth.

Desis online were left scratching their heads and questioning the blogger's ideas. While some were utterly disgusted, others were simply confused.

One user wrote, 'I am intrigued by the creativity, but why does she want orange lips'. While another user commented, 'THIS IS SO WRONG'.

In the end, Christianson learnt its chemical disadvantages the hard way. Another video of hers went viral and was shared extensively online where she revealed that the lip colour caused allergies. In the video, she talked about the fact that it took two days for the allergies to completely go away.

Lesson learnt."
Lee Kun-hee: Passing Of a Corporate Titan,2020-10-26 00:00:00,"With the passing of Lee Kun-hee, a vital chapter of the transformation of the Samsung Group into one of the world’s powerhouses of technology and innovation comes to an end.

The chapter did not begin in 1987 when he succeeded his father as chairman, but in 1993, when he convened a meeting of his senior-most executives in Frankfurt to announce a quality revolution at the company — no more shoddy stuff that sold at a grudging pace and required constant servicing afterwards.

In 1995, he made his staff watch a bonfire of 150,000 pieces of the company’s electronic equipment, mostly mobile phones, that did not meet his expectation of quality.

Thanks to his leadership, Samsung today is one of the world’s largest corporate spenders on R&D. Days before he died, Samsung and Stanford University announced the development of an OLED display that carries more than 10,000 pixels per square inch, more than 20 times the pixel density available in a flagship phone screen today.

This paves the way for better virtual and augmented reality kit. The short point is that in two generations of visionary leadership, a company that sold dry fish and other grocery in a South Korean town became the world’s largest producer of mobile phones and memory chips, and is a driving force of the South Korean economy, the world’s 12th largest, although its population is smaller than Tamil Nadu’s.

Ambition, commitment and hard work are not anyone’s monopoly. The Samsung model is up for grabs — for Indian companies, as well.

South Korea’s policy of forcing its companies to compete with the best in the world helped, apart from management will to excel. India chooses to shelter its companies from foreign competition.

This, too, much change, for a Samsung to emerge here."
"If Delhi Metro can, why can’t the rest?",2020-10-26 00:00:00,"A report by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation highlights the tardy pace of project implementation in the country. Of the total 1,661 infrastructure projects in the central sector, each of which costs at least Rs 150 crore, 441 projects are faced with cost overruns as on September 1, 2020.

This is mainly due to delays in land acquisition, green clearance and law and order problems. With the expected contraction of the economy this fiscal, averting project delays and expeditious execution are more important than ever as these projects can add to economic recovery.

A major problem that impedes infrastructure development is land acquisition. Anyone who has to give up land must be compensated for its growing valuation over time.

A viable option would be through leasing or an annuity-based system as practised in some states. The rest of the clearances should be given expeditiously.

There is no reason why green clearances cannot be given within a reasonable time frame after an environmental assessment impact. Project financing should be tied up expeditiously and funds released when required. Monitoring must be rigorous, and open to scrutiny by any interested party.

The total cost of implementation of 1,661 projects is estimated at about Rs 25.26 lakh crore against the original cost of Rs 20.9 lakh crore, reflecting a cost overrun of 20.81%. The highest number of delayed projects are in Railways, followed by road transport, highways and petroleum.

Delays lengthen gestation periods, depressing output per unit of capital invested. Nine projects (original cost of `16,106 crore) are ahead of schedule and 206 projects (original cost `5.09 lakh crore) are on schedule.

This is welcome. Both government agencies involved in project approvals and the private party involved in implementing the project should be held to account for delays at their end. The government should also act to remove the fear of criminal intent being discovered behind any exercise of discretion, to speed up project implementation, and boost the economy"

"IPL 2020, RR vs MI: Ben Stokes, Sanju Samson star as Rajasthan Royals beat Mumbai Indians by 8 wickets",,Rajasthan did not start well with the bat as they lost Uthappa early and Smith did not last long as well. There would have been alarm bells ringing as Stokes was not in good form coming into this game just like Samson but they proved everyone wrong as Stokes was magnificent as he reached his century and took Rajasthan home. It was just mesmerizing to watch as he took the bowlers apart. This is the Stokes that we all have come to know and Rajasthan would hope that he continues to perform like this in their upcoming games. The thing that would have pleased them would have been Sanju Samson. He gave himself time at the start and then found the boundaries at will. He gave able support to Stokes and they ended up on the winning side. Very rarely do you see such a big score chased down by Rajasthan without Jos Buttler being in the thick of things.

Coronavirus symptoms and precautions: All you need to know,,"What is coronavirus?

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?

Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?

Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?

It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said. What is the treatment for novel coronavirus?

There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately.

Here is a list of dos and don'ts issued by the government to stall the spread of the virus in the country —

Do's

Cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissue or handkerchief

Frequently wash your hands with soap and water

Avoid crowded places

Person suffering from Influenza like illness must be confined at home

Stay more than one arm's length distance from persons sick with flu

Take adequate sleep and rest

Drink plenty of water/liquids and eat nutritious food

Person suspected with Influenza like illness must consult doctor

Don'ts

Touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands while coughing or sneezing

NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases."

The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc, which is helping manufacture the vaccine, said on Monday. A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people."
Coronavirus cases in India: Sharpest weekly drop in Covid numbers,,"Sixth straight week of decline in fresh Covid cases in India

NEW DELHI: In the steepest weekly fall yet in Covid-19 numbers in India, fresh infections recorded this week (October 19-25) were nearly 16% less than the previous week’s tally while deaths from the virus fell by 19% during this period.India recorded just over 3.6 lakh fresh cases during the week, the lowest in absolute terms in three months (since 3.2 lakh were detected in the July 20-26 week), as per data collated from state governments.This marked a drop of 15.7% from the previous week’s numbers, the sharpest weekly fall in cases since the pandemic hit India. Last week, nearly 4.3 lakh cases were recorded in the country.This was the sixth straight week of decline in fresh Covid-19 cases from the peak of 6,45,014 infections reported during September 7-13, indicating a sustained reduction in the pandemic’s spread in India.Meanwhile, India achieved another positive milestone when the number of recoveries crossed 90% of all cases on Sunday. Close to 71.3 lakh people have now recovered from the infection, out of a total caseload so far of 79.1 lakh, as per TOI’s database. Deaths from the virus were down 19% from last week’s toll. This week India recorded just over 4,400 fatalities due to Covid-19, as compared with 5,455 last week. Deaths too have been declining for five consecutive weeks since peaking at 8,175 during September 14-20.Last week (October 12-18) had seen a 13.3% fall in fresh cases and a 15.9% drop in fatalities, the highest weekly fall till then. The fall in daily cases continued, with 46,135 fresh infections recorded on Sunday. This was the lowest daily tally of cases (not counting Mondays when the numbers fall due to other reasons) in 95 days since 38,444 cases were reported on July 21. Sunday’s death toll, at 489, was also the lowest daily fatalities in 108 days since July 9.Numbers fell in almost all states on Sunday, which also coincided with festivals of Dussehra and Durga Puja. Delhi was an exception, recording 4,136 fresh cases, the highest in 38 days. This is despite the fact that there has been no drop in testing. Karnataka became the third state in the country to record 8 lakh Covid-19 cases. It reached the grim milestone with 4,439 fresh cases taking the total to 8,02,813 on Sunday. Gujarat added 919 new cases, taking the total to 1.67 lakh. The new cases in Gujarat included 227 from Surat, 174 from Ahmedabad, 115 from Vadodara, and 97 from Rajkot."
Coronavirus vaccine storage issues could leave 3 billion people without access,,"GAMPELA, BURKINA FASO: The chain breaks here, in a tiny medical clinic in Burkina Faso that went nearly a year without a working refrigerator.From factory to syringe, the world's most promising coronavirus vaccine candidates need non-stop sterile refrigeration to stay potent and safe. But despite enormous strides in equipping developing countries to maintain the vaccine ""cold chain,"" nearly 3 billion of the world's 7.8 billion people live where temperature-controlled storage is insufficient for an immunization campaign to bring Covid-19 under control.The result: Poor people around the world who were among the hardest hit by the virus pandemic are also likely to be the last to recover from it.The vaccine cold chain hurdle is just the latest disparity of the pandemic weighted against the poor, who more often live and work in crowded conditions that allow the virus to spread, have little access to medical oxygen that is vital to Covid-19 treatment, and whose health systems lack labs, supplies or technicians to carry out large-scale testing.Maintaining the cold chain for coronavirus vaccines won't be easy even in the richest of countries, especially when it comes to those that require ultracold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F). Investment in infrastructure and cooling technology lags behind the high-speed leap that vaccine development has taken this year due to the virus.With the pandemic now in its eighth month, logistics experts warn that vast parts of the world lack the refrigeration to administer an effective vaccination program. This includes most of Central Asia, much of India and southeast Asia, Latin America except for the largest countries, and all but a tiny corner of Africa.The medical clinic outside Burkina Faso's capital, a dirt-streaked building that serves a population of 11,000, is a microcosm of the obstacles.After its refrigerator broke last fall, the clinic could no longer keep vaccines against tetanus, yellow fever, tuberculosis and other common diseases on site, nurse Julienne Zoungrana said. Staff instead used motorbikes to fetch vials in insulated carriers from a hospital in Ouagadougou, making a 40-minute round-trip drive on a narrow road that varies between dirt, gravel and pavement.A mother of two who visits the Gampela clinic says she thinks a coronavirus inoculation program will be challenging in her part of the world. Adama Tapsoba, 24, walks four hours under scorching sun to get her baby his routine immunizations and often waits hours more to see a doctor. A week earlier, her 5-month-old son had missed a scheduled shot because Tapsoba's daughter was sick and she could only bring one child on foot.""It will be hard to get a (COIVD-19) vaccine,"" Tapsoba said, bouncing her 5-month-old son on her lap outside the clinic. ""People will have to wait at the hospital, and they might leave without getting it.""To uphold the cold chain in developing nations, international organizations have overseen the installation of tens of thousands of solar-powered vaccine refrigerators. Keeping vaccines at stable temperatures from the time they are made until they are given to patients also requires mobile refrigeration, reliable electricity, sound roads and, above all, advance planning.For poor countries like Burkina Faso, the best chance of receiving a coronavirus vaccine is through the Covax initiative, led by the World Health Organization and the Gavi vaccine alliance. The goal of Covax is to place orders for multiple promising vaccine candidates and to allocate the successful ones equitably.The United Nations' children's agency, UNICEF, began laying the global distribution groundwork months ago, in Copenhagen. At the world's largest humanitarian aid warehouse, logistics staff are trying to foresee shortages by learning from the past, especially the spring chaos surrounding global shortages of masks and other protective gear that were commandeered off airport tarmacs or stolen and traded on the black market.Currently, 42 coronavirus vaccine candidates are in clinical trials and another 151 are in pre-clinical evaluation, according to WHO. The ones most likely to end up in the Covax mix must be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (25-46 F).A Pfizer candidate is among the ones in advanced testing requiring storage at ultracold temperatures. The company, which has designed a special carrying case for its vaccine, has expressed interest in Covax and signed contracts with the United States, Europe and Japan.Medical freezers that go down to minus 70 degrees Celsius are rare even in US and European hospitals. Many experts believe the West African countries that suffered through a 2014-16 Ebola outbreak may be the best positioned, because a vaccine against that virus also requires ultracold storage.For more than two-thirds of the world, however, the advanced technology is nowhere on the horizon, according to a study by German logistics company DHL. Meanwhile, billions of people are in countries that don't have the necessary infrastructure to maintain the cold chain for either existing vaccines or more conventional coronavirus candidates, the study said.Opportunities for vaccines to be lost expand the farther a vaccine travels. DHL estimated that 15,000 cargo flights would be required to vaccinate the entire planet against Covid-19, stretching global capacity for aircraft and potentially supplies of materials such as dry ice.""We need to find a bridge"" for every gap in the cold chain, DHL chief commercial officer Katja Busch said. ""We're talking about investments ... as a society, this is something we have to do.""Gavi and UNICEF worked before the pandemic to supply much of Africa and Asia with refrigeration for vaccines, fitting out 40,000 facilities since 2017. UNICEF is now offering governments a checklist of what they will need to maintain a vaccine supply chain and asking them to develop a plan.""The governments are in charge of what needs to happen in the end,"" said Benjamin Schreiber, who is among the directors of UNICEF's vaccination program.Cracks in the global cold chain start once vaccines leave the factory. Container ships are not equipped to refrigerate pharmaceutical products with a limited shelf life. Shipping vaccines by air costs a lot more, and air cargo traffic is only now rebounding from pandemic-related border closures.Even when flights are cold and frequent enough, air freight carries other potential hazards. WHO estimates that as much as half of vaccines globally are lost to wastage, sometimes due to heat exposure or vials breaking while in transit. With coronavirus vaccines, which will be one of the world's most sought-after products, theft is also a danger.""They can't be left on a tarmac and fought over because they would actually be spoiled and they would have no value, or worse still, people would still be trying to distribute them,"" said Glyn Hughes, the global head of cargo for the International Air Transport Association.Tinglong Dai, a Johns Hopkins University researcher who specializes in health care logistics, said creativity will be needed to keep the cold chain intact while coronavirus vaccines are distributed on a global scale. Gavi and UNICEF have experimented with delivering vaccines by drone. Indian officials have floated the idea of setting aside part of the country's vast food storage network for the coronavirus vaccines.""If people can figure out how to transport ice cream, they can transport vaccines,"" Dai said.Temperature-sensitive labels that change color when a vaccine is exposed to heat too long and no longer safe to use, and live delivery tracking to ensure vaccines reach their destinations as intended also have allowed for progress in delivering safe shots.Yet chances for something to go wrong multiply on the ground as vaccines are prepped to leave national depots. Since the cold chain is so fragile, logistics planning is crucial; syringes and disposal boxes must be available as soon as vaccine shipments arrive.By the end of the year, UNICEF expects to have 520 million syringes pre-positioned for coronavirus vaccines in the developing world and maps of where the refrigeration needs are greatest ""to ensure that these supplies arrive in countries by the time the vaccines do,"" Executive Director Henrietta Fore said.The last vaccine requiring cold storage that India's national program adopted was for rotavirus, a stomach bug that typically affects babies and young children. Dr Gagandeep Kang, who led the research for that vaccine, estimated that India has about 30% less storage capacity than it would need for a coronavirus vaccine.In countries such as India and Burkina Faso, a lack of public transportation presents another obstacle to getting citizens inoculated before vaccines go bad.Dr. Aquinas Edassery, who runs two clinics in one of India's poorest and least developed regions, said patients must walk for hours to receive health care. The trip on a single road that winds 86 kilometers (53 miles) over steep hills and washes out for months at a time will pose an insurmountable barrier for many residents of the eastern district of Rayagada, Edassery said.As with most logistics, the last kilometer (mile) is the hardest part of delivering a coronavirus vaccine to the people who need it. In Latin America, perhaps nowhere more than Venezuela provides a glimpse into how the vaccine cold chain could go dramatically off course.When a blackout last year left much of the nation in the dark for a week, doctors in several parts of Venezuela reported losing stocks of vaccines. The country's largest children's hospital had to discard thousands of doses of vaccines for illnesses like diphtheria, according to Dr. Huniades Urbina, head of the Venezuelan Society of Childcare and Pediatrics.""We won't be able to halt either the coronavirus or measles,"" Urbina said.Preserving the cold chain has only grown more difficult since then. Gas shortages limit the ability to move vaccines quickly from one part of Venezuela to another. Dry ice to keep vaccines cool during transport is harder to find. And after years of economic decline, there also are fewer doctors and other professionals trained to keep the chain intact.""I'm not optimistic on how the vaccine would be distributed in the inner states because there is no infrastructure of any kind to guarantee delivery — or if it gets delivered, guarantees the adequate preservation under cold conditions,"" Dr Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a Venezuelan pathologist, said.Venezuela presents an extreme example, but a coronavirus vaccine also is likely to test parts of Latin America with more robust health care systems. In Peru, private businesses that typically transport fish and beef have offered their trucks, though it remains unclear whether the Health Ministry will accept.Back in Burkina Faso, vaccination days became an ordeal at the Gampela clinic when the refrigerator went out, said Zoungrana, the nurse. Staff members on hospital courier runs must buy fuel they often can't afford and make a second trip to and from the capital to return any unused doses.""We're suffering,"" said Zoungrana, who was run off the road on her motorbike just a few weeks ago.Days after journalists from The Associated Press visited the clinic this month, a long-awaited solar refrigerator arrived. With technicians in short supply, the clinic was waiting to be sure the appliance would function properly before stocking it with vaccines.Nationwide, Burkina Faso is about 1,000 clinical refrigerators short, and less than 40% of the health facilities that conduct vaccinations have reliable fridges, national vaccination director Issa Ouedraogo said.Multi-dose vials — the equivalent of bulk storage for vaccines — can drastically reduce global transportation costs. But once a vial is opened, its shelf life counts down even faster; if too few people show up for their jabs in time, whatever remains in the larger vials must be discarded.""It's really upsetting to have wastage like that. It'll result in loss of lives and pain and suffering. It's a waste of resources, "" said University of Massachusetts at Amherst professor Anna Nagurney, who studies supply chain logistics.For now, UNICEF is betting on 20-dose vials of coronavirus vaccine and hoping that the amount wasted will stay below 3% for closed vials and 15% for open multi-dose vials that do not get used up, according to Michelle Siedel, one of the UN agency's cold chain experts.If Burkina Faso were given 1 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine today, the country wouldn't be able to handle it, Jean-Claude Mubalama, UNICEF's head of health and nutrition for the African nation.""If we had to vaccinate against the coronavirus now, at this moment, it would be impossible,"" he said."

NEW DELHI: India's limited-over vice-captain and senior opener Rohit Sharma was on Monday left out of all three squads for the tour of Australia due to a recurring hamstring injury which is set to oust him from the remainder of the Indian Premier League as well.In Rohit's absence, the in-form KL Rahul will be Virat Kohli 's deputy in the white ball teams and is also back in the Test squad after a considerable period of time. Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant failed to make the cut for the limited overs even though he retained his place in the Test squad.""The BCCI Medical Team will continue to monitor the progress of Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma ,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a press release announcing the squads.The tour of Australia comprises three T20 Internationals, as many ODIs and four Tests. It is set to get underway from November 27.It is learnt that in case of Rohit, it might take a good six to eight weeks for complete recovery from the injury that he picked up during the IPL.""It is unlikely that Rohit will take any further part in this year's Indian Premier League. He will have to go back to India and be at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for the rehabilitation,"" a senior BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The story of Monday's selection was undoubtedly Rahul, who is also now India's first-choice keeper in both T20 Internationals and ODIs as selectors finally ran out of patience with Pant.""Rahul is being looked as India's first choice white-ball keeper till the 2021 World T20 and beyond. Also he has impressed everyone with his leadership skills and that's why this elevation as vice-captain,"" the source said.Sanju Samson will be the second wicket-keeper in T20 International squad which also features Kolkata Knight Riders' mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy .Among other notable inclusions, pacer Mohammed Siraj has been rewarded with a Test call-up for his consistent red-ball performances. The absence of the injured duo of Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar also paved the way for his selection.""Siraj and (Navdeep) Saini were automatic choices in the Test team once Bhuvi (thigh muscle) and Ishant (Left rib cage) were ruled out,"" the source said.It is understood that Pant's dodgy fitness and tendency to put on weight has not gone down well with Sunil Joshi-led selection committee, which wanted him to be served a wake-up call.""In any case, all three teams will be there, Pant, if need be, can be added to the squad,"" the source added.It is undoubtedly a big day for the 29-year-old Chennai-based architect Varun, who has played 21 representative matches at the senior level, including 11 T20 games -- all at the IPL.His five-wicket haul against Delhi Capitals is one of the highlights of this IPL and he has bowled brilliantly at the death mixing his clever variations.With Kuldeep Yadav not being preferred by his own franchise for the better part, it is Varun, who has stolen the limelight.The tour will also prove to be a good exposure for T Natarajan, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kartik Tyagi and Ishan Porel.""Ishan will primarily be a red ball net bowler while Natarajan provides the left-arm variation training for white ball. Kartik Tyagi bowls good yorkers and Kamlesh has pace.

Micro review: 'Leave the World Behind' by Rumaan Alam,,"'Leave the World Behind' by Rumaan Alam is a riveting suspense that will keep you hooked.This interesting book is hard to classify into one genre. It starts with a middle-aged couple from New York going on a vacation with their two teenagers. They choose a lavish Airbnb in a fairly remote area and are horrified one night when a couple comes knocking saying the house is theirs. They say that there has been a blackout in New York and which has seemingly spread here as well. The house had no TV and now there is no internet so there is no way of finding out what is truly happening in the outside world. The two families have to live together uncomfortably as they suspect each other and question what is happening constantly.The narration is from a third-person omniscient point of view and even shows the reader what is happening outside the bubble both the families are living in. The writing is excellent, detailed yet suspenseful. Some details that seemed tedious in the beginning turn out to be significant later on. The book highlights how fear affects people, the protectiveness one has towards family and the uncomfortable racial biases all have in America. It's a suspenseful and enjoyable read.""If the first half can turn a mirror on you, the second half will shatter it . . . Undeniably haunting"", wrote New York Times""Like Stephen King's 1980 novella The Mist, Leave the World Behind expertly illustrates the horror of the unknown, the almost painful humanity we feel when facing down the end and, of course, human nature under duress. During an era of plague, racism, hatred, and division, this tale of a vacation gone awry is terrifyingly prescient,"" reviewed Rolling Stone"
"""COVID-19 is emotionally exhaustive for even the young and healthy"": Malaika Arora on her battle with COVID-19",,"Even as COVID-19 continues to surge across the world, there are many who still believe that the virus doesn't really afflict the young and healthy. While COVID-19 carries greater risks for those with preexisting health conditions and age, it can impose problems for those who are young and healthy as well.The WHO, too, has warned the younger generation to not be too complacent in their actions. Researchers have also revealed how high hospitalization rates have been reported amongst people below the age of 40 in India.After actor Harshvardhan Rane, 36, revealed that he required ICU admission and oxygen support, Malaika Arora has now opened up about how COVID-19 really tested her in the past month.Malaika, 47, tested positive for COVID-19 in the middle of September. While the actress only suffered from ""mild"" symptoms and was put under home isolation, the two weeks isolation time was excruciatingly tough for her, mentally and physically.In an interview with a health portal, the ace dancer and reality television judge spoke about the challenges she encountered, which baffled her. While Malaika is one of the fittest and healthiest celebrities, her brush with the virus made her realize how much distress her body was in.""I think everybody was really shocked and kept telling me ‘you’re someone who is so fit, how did you get covid? I think that’s a myth.""The most exhaustive thing for her was to stay away from people during her quarantine period, which she terms as the ""strangest"" thing:“You are so unwell! If you’re asymptomatic, then it’s fine. But if you have symptoms, it’s a huge challenge because you have to take care, be vigilant... it’s not something you can deal within two to three days, the time period is 14 days, which is a long time. But it’s important to stay calm and be positive,”The vegan yogini, who co-owns a chain of yoga studios also shared that some of the symptoms she encountered include loss of smell and taste, sore throat, for which, she made use of a lot of home remedies and steam inhalation.The mother of one also credits her daily exercise regime, along with meditation to speeding up recovery.""In those 14 days, I knew how weak I was, it was so difficult to go back to things I was doing every single day of my life. I started jogging and running a little, just to see whether my body was weak, or my lungs were able to take it. If you have the energy, a little bit of yoga or breathing exercises are good. I also tried to religiously sit in the sun every morning for 40 minutes, and that really helped. We have age and health on our side, that’s why people insist on doing some form of physical activity is a must. I feel that part of me really helped me to recover. All I would say is don’t take covid for granted even if you’re fit,”Battling post-COVID symptomsWhile Malaika has slowly and gradually resumed a normal pace of life, there are still some symptoms which continue to linger. Weakness and fatigue, two of the most commonly present symptoms affected the 47-year-old post recovery. However, determined to challenge her body, the former model took up exercising to ""test"" her body, which she feels helped her greatly.Hair loss is something that impacted her greatly, and she also took to Instagram to share natural remedies which are helping her get back."

"Coronavirus: Children can be long haulers too, finds a new study",,"Long haul COVID is the newest worry plaguing experts. From lingering cough, breathlessness and anxiety, patients are coming back to clinics weeks and months after testing negative. World over, over 75% COVID19 recovered patients are being diagnosed with symptoms of post COVID. Newer studies now suggest that kids, who make up for less than 10% of COVID cases worldwide, could be the newest victim of long haul COVID.While it was assumed that the post-COVID fatigue only impacted adults, case studies have now shown that even the little ones can be COVID long haulers. It could be yet another way how COVID impacts children differently than adults.Although novel coronavirus is a scary pandemic for all age groups, so far, the disease has carried different implications for younger children. While kids haven't been found to be vulnerable to severe COVID, some studies suggest that kids could be asymptomatic, act as silent carriers, shedding the virus for weeks at a stretch.If the newest findings are true, it might make the case of schools and public spaces reopening for kids even more perplexing.Reports of a 12-year-old, perhaps the world's youngest COVID long hauler came to light recently.In an interview with New York Times, Maggie, who contracted the virus with her parents some months back said that lingering symptoms felt like a burden for her.“It felt like an elephant sitting on my chest...It was hard to take a deep breath, I was nauseous all the time, I didn’t want to eat, I was very light-headed when I stood up or even just lying down.”Another example of long-time repurcussions of COVID would be 9-year-old Eli Lipman. In an interview, appearing along with his father, Eli mentioned that the lingering symptoms, which went on for five months were one of the hardest things for him to go though:“It is a big deal and it will hurt. Sometimes, you are not okay. Kids with long-haul; you might not be okay but the good side is you will get better. Five months before, I felt like I would die. I felt super tired, couldn’t get up and didn’t feel like doing anything. Now, I am getting better now and even feeling more energetic.”While the case study will require a lot more research, it just goes on to prove that kids would require the same level of care and precautions as adults.Children and adults require the same level of care and attention post COVID. Pediatric long haulers may also likely require life-long care post COVID recovery. One of the most striking symptoms of COVID-19 in children is Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, which generates a strong immune response and may even cause life-threatening complications in some, including seizures, excruciating pain, recurring fevers and respiratory distress. Even though rare, these complications do pose a threat.Kids' mental well-being needs to be paid attention to as well. While brain fog is one of the most common post COVID symptoms in children, cognitive impairment and neural slowdown may pose threats too. Even if the complications might be rare, it is important to be prepared for outcomes."

The fruit is known by different names, such as red dates, Chinese date, Korean date and is widely cultivated across South Asia.Ber also holds a great significance in Hindu mythology, as Shabari offered this fruit to Lord Ram while he was passing through the jungle to find Sita.

However, in the wake of COVID pandemic this year, the previous schedule set for October has been delayed.However, the said process of demarcation of beach shacks in South Goa is yet to start as the tourism department is short of manpower to get started with it.

They are hoping that the upcoming festive season might likely help them boost their sales. As of now, the state is registering incoming domestic tourists; foreign arrivals have not started yet, and charter flights are yet to be functional.There are shack operators that rely exclusively on charter tourists; however, this season will likely be different as the holiday season will begin without any charter arrival.With COVID-19 still not gone and losses suffered by operators due to the pandemic, the government has announced to reduce the licence fee for shacks by 50 per cent."

Around India in 80 Trains,,"Traversing 65,000 kilometres in 80 trains around India was a life-altering experience for journalist Monisha Rajesh. After four months of hectic train journeys covering the length and breadth of the country, she penned her bittersweet memories in a book named Around India in 80 Trains. With Jules Verne (the author of Around the World in 80 Days) as her inspiration, the vast Indian terrain and the diverse group of people as her constant companion over four months, Rajesh's journey from Delhi to Mumbai to Kanyakumari taught her that the best way to understand and explore the rich and diverse Indian culture is through the railway network.""On a very grey, miserable morning in November 2009, I read an article about India's domestic airlines connecting 80 cities. I pulled out a map of the country and looked at some of these cities, many of which I had never heard of. However, beneath these routes was a fabulously intricate line that threaded its way across the entire stretch. It took some time for me to realise it was India's rail network. In a matter of moments, 'around India in 80 planes' morphed into 'around India in 80 trains' in my head. That's how my journey began.""Excerpts from an interview:Aeroplanes are so generic and bland. At the very most you talk to one, maybe two people, and the subject is never more than asking if you can squeeze past to get to the toilet, or polite chatter about the destination. It's restrictive and very selfcontained, which is fine if you are just trying to get from A to B; but to enjoy travel for the sake of travel, train journeys are unrivalled. On trains, particularly Indian trains, there is such a vast turnout of passengers on a single journey.You can fall asleep, wake up, and find that you have three new companions in your compartment with whom you can begin a new conversation.I didn't want to plan a rigid route. From the outset, I wanted to capture the serendipitous nature of travel. I booked a handful of trains for the first two weeks, and left the rest to chance. That was the only way to get a first-hand experience of the ticketing bureaucracy, deal with agents, argue with the touts, which all make for great storytelling. However, I did also choose the route depending on certain events that I wanted to witness: a solar eclipse in Kanyakumari; a classical dance festival in Khajuraho; orthopedic surgery on a hospital train in Madhya Pradesh... I worked out the trains between each of these events.I travelled on the Indian Maharaja Deccan-Odyssey. It takes in the traditional route through the short Golden Triangle (Delhi-Agra-Jaipur), but also includes Ellora and Ajanta. We covered Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Sawai Madhopur, Udaipur, Ellora Caves, Ajanta Caves and reached Mumbai on the eighth day. I expected the luxury train experience to be something out of an Agatha Christie TV adaptation; but the reality was quite different. The travel was a lot more laid back and no one had to dress for dinner! I did come across a lot of retirees and stereotypical British tourists, who were appalled by poverty; but for the most part it was a very entertaining journey and a lovely way to see Rajasthan. It was quite bizarre riding an exercise bike in the train by the window and watching the Thar desert sweep by outside. The food was exceptional and the service was impeccable.The Konkan Railways was my favourite segment. It's the 760 km stretch on the southwestern coast, that runs with the Arabian Sea on one side and the Sahyadri Hills on the other. I'm sure Indian Railways would hate me saying this, but the best bit about Indian trains is that you can sit in the doorways and watch the scenery inch past you. Sometimes you can actually reach through the windows and grab bits of the foliage. I also enjoyed utterly delicious food that the vendors brought in - chicken lollipops, spring rolls and biryani.The Lifeline Express - the world's first hospital train was an eye-opener. It was founded more than 20 years ago by an NGO to bring free medical care to the neglected rural poor. They realised that if they couldn't bring people to cities for medical care, they could take the medical facilities out to them using the railway network.The train parks for up to five weeks at a location deemed worthy of medical attention, and patients are screened and then invited on board for orthopaedic surgery, cleft-lip repair, hearing and visual impairments; they even offer counselling for epilepsy. For so many middle-class Indians, the railway is just a way to get to a destination. But the Lifeline Express showed me that the railway network was the bloodstream that kept the country's heart beating. People's lives are dependent on the train and without it they probably wouldn't survive.I took a day train from Jaisalmer to Bikaner on a very hot day in March. I almost fainted. I couldn't understand why no one else was on board apart from the train ticket inspector and a couple of officers who boarded at Phalodi Air Base. It dawned on me when the dust came sweeping through the barred windows. I felt like I was standing in the barrel of a giant hairdryer. Never again!If anything, Londoners could learn from Indian train travellers; they should learn how to cheer up and not look so surly and miserable all the time. The lovely bit about train travel in India is the interaction and the complete lack of social boundaries. On London tubes, everyone is so self contained. Train is just a means of transport, not a place to interact or mingle.That said, cleanliness is the one thing that could be worked upon by the Indian Railways. The indiscriminate chucking of rubbish bothered me on a daily basis and most passengers were indifferent to keeping communal areas tidy for each other.Dwarka in the West, Udhampur in the North, Ledo in the East and Kanyakumari in the South - the four tips of the Indian Railways.The people who I met made the most lasting impressions. They are the ones who made the train journeys memorable. I would often forget where I was, what time it was and where I was travelling to because of the nature of my companions. They shaped my journeys and made me either love them or loathe them. From a visual perspective, sitting in train doorways and watching sunsets became a nightly ritual and an unforgettable experience.Travel during the day. If you are travelling overnight, make sure that you are in a compartment with families or other women. Though I rarely travelled in ladies-only compartments, I did ask for upper berths as I felt safer there at night. Other than that everyone needs to apply common sense and be responsible for themselves. One needs to rely on one's own judgment rather than others' to stay safe. I made sure I didn't wander somewhere unfamiliar at night and I always kept my credit card and passport on a thin string purse around my neck and under my clothing."

Home Credit Loan: Home Loan Eligibility: What is the maximum amount of home loan one can borrow?,,"Here are some of the points that will determine the amount of your home loan:

1. Downpayment

2. Your eligibility

3. Your affordability of paying EMIs

The maximum home loan amount you can get depends on your credit worthiness and borrowing potential determined in terms of the norms and standards of the bank.Usually builders ask buyers to pay 10-20 per cent of the value of the property as downpayment. Rest 80-90 per cent can be financed from the bank. You can choose to pay more from your pocket if you can afford. You must save up for the downpayment before finalaysing a property. In case, there is a deficit, you might have take soft loan from your employer, family and friends. Try to minimise the borrowing amount to reduce the interest outgo.Home loan lenders have a list of eligibility criterion and only if you happen to meet those, you are considered a potential borrower. Banks typically look at your credit history to understand your repayment habits and prefer a credit score of 750 for lending out. Your age, income, occupation, collateral security, margin requirements, etc. are also important factors when it comes to determining the interest on the loan.Many times buyers take up a lot of burden when it comes to paying EMI thinking that it would get easier with time, as their income would increase eventually. Consider the possibilities of not getting a raise soon or other unforeseen circumstances. You should look at a loan to income ratio of 20% to 30%. You can make changes in the tenure to reduce or increase the EMI amount depending on your affordability."

POINTS TABLE

DUBAI: Chennai Super Kings ' IPL campaign may well end on Monday, which will be their first without reaching the play-offs, if KKR win their next match but Mahendra Singh Dhoni wants his team to enjoy it even as they endure a painful next 12 hours.KKR are on 12 points and a win against KXIP on Monday will take them to 14 points. Three other sides -- Mumbai Indians , Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore -- have already got 14 points.CSK, on the other hand, can go up to 12 points even if they win their next two games.""It does hurt when you don't do well so you try to amplify certain emotions. So that the guys just don't drop the game. That can leave with 12 painful hours of the remaining time in the tournament. You have to enjoy the game no matter where you are on the table,"" Dhoni said during the post-match presentation.The last two games could well be inconsequential but the CSK skipper wants his men to just go out there and enjoy themselves.""If you are not enjoying the cricket , it can become cruel and painful. So I am glad with how the youngsters have responded.""The eight-wicket victory over RCB on Sunday was the kind of performance that Dhoni always wanted from his team during the tournament.""I felt this one was one of the perfect games. Everything went to plan, and the execution was there. We kept picking wickets, and kept them to a total that was slightly below par.""He lauded spinners Imran Tahir and Mitchell Santner who kept things tight while Ruturaj Gaikwad also got some amount of praise from the legend.""The wicket was on a slower side, and the spinners did a good job. We haven't been very consistent with the batting.""Today, the start was very good. Rutu batted well. He backed himself to play the shots he is known for. Looking to time the ball, if you look for four, you can get six,"" Dhoni said."
Bihar election 2020: Campaigning for first phase ends,,"More on

PATNA: In what has ultimately turned out to be a high-decibel campaigning by the leaders of political parties in the Bihar assembly polls, the electioneering for the 71 seats going to polls in the first phase on October 28 ended Monday, belying the early fears that voters were largely disinterested.On Monday, while the state police and central government officials were busy overseeing preparations of stage for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s second-leg address at Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur and Patna on October 28, chief minister Nitish Kumar addressed four rallies, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav from the RJD-led grand alliance 12, and BJP national president J P Nadda delivered address at two places, mainly for the second phase which will go to the polls on November 3.The first phase of polling has already witnessed campaigning by PM Modi at three places and by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at two places on October 23. Their address schedule had even coincided with PM addressing a rally at Bhagalpur and Rahul at Kahalgaon, just 35 km apart.The BJP marshalled resources like 13 helicopters and its 40 star campaigners, including PM Modi, Nadda, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, defence minister Rajnath Singh and UP CM Adityanath Yogi, besides state leaders like deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and health minister Mangal Pandey. On the other hand, the RJD mustered just one helicopter and the Congress two.However, the Covid-19 caused its own share of inflictions, as Fadnavis, Sushil Modi and Pandey went in quarantine, and two ministers, one each from the BJP and JD(U), died due to the lethal attack in the pandemic.In the first phase, there are 1,066 candidates in the fray and over 21.46 lakh people will exercise their franchise. Among its 29 candidates, the BJP has fielded Commonwealth Games gold medalist Shreyasi Singh from the Jamui seat. The RJD’s Divya Prakash (28), contesting the Tarapur seat, is the youngest among all candidates. The JD(U) and RJD are contesting 42 seats each and the Congress is fighting on 20 constituencies.Moreover, the 71 seats are spread over 16 districts, which lie in south Bihar (or south of the river Ganga), including 14 districts which were hit by Maoist activities at one time or the other.Battling the high-incumbency factor, the NDA’s CM face and JD(U) national president Nitish Kumar has addressed meetings in around three dozen constituencies to protect his turf. However, his pitch has been made slippery after Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan decided to fielded his party's candidates against the JD(U) nominees.Nitish has been banking mainly on the preponderant extremely backward caste (EBC), and also women sections on account of the complete prohibition that he imposed in the state in 2016, besides the steps taken for their empowerment - like 50% reservation in the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PTIs) and urban local bodies, as well as 35% job reservation for women in government jobs.However, the CM aspirant from the RJD-led grand alliance, Tejashwi Yadav, continued to build pressure on the NDA and also queer its pitch from Day one, as he promised to give 10 lakh jobs to youths in the state.His physical rallies have attracted more people, including youths, forcing the doubting Thomases to wonder whether the people would also show up at the polling booths to vote for the Grand Alliance.Both PM Modi and Nitish took the fight to the RJD-led grand alliance by reminding people of the 15-year “Lalu Rabri rule”, dubbing it as ‘jungle raj’ and saying that it was bereft of developmental initiatives and activities. In contrast, they said the NDA rule saw all around development activities, including in the road, bridge and power sector, from 2005-2020.The BJP leaders have also raised the issues of Galwan Valley skirmish between India and China, sacrifice by jawans of Bihar Regiment, Pakistan, terror attacks, abrogation of Article 370, declaration of Gupkar Alliance against abrogation of Article 370, and construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya."

Vaccine hopes rise as Oxford jab prompts immune response among old as well as young adults,,"Common cold virus

LONDON: One of the world's leading Covid-19 experimental vaccines produces a immune response in both young and old adults, raising hopes of a path out of the gloom and economic destruction wrought by the novel coronavirus The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc , which is helping manufacture the vaccine, said on Monday.A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.""It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the Covid-19 disease severity is higher,"" an AstraZeneca spokesman said.""The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,"" the spokesman said, referring to the technical name of the vaccine.The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate, as the world tries to plot a path out of the Covid-19 pandemic.The news that older people get an immune response from the vaccine is positive because the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus.If it works, a vaccine would allow the world to return to some measure of normality after the tumult of the pandemic.British health secretary Matt Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready but he was preparing logistics for a possible roll out mostly in the first half of 2021.Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year he told the BBC: ""I don't rule that out but that is not my central expectation.""""The programme is progressing well, (but) we're not there yet,"" Hancock said.Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the Financial Times reported earlier.Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, the FT said. It did not name the publication.People aware of the results from so-called immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants say the findings echo data released in July that showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55.AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial.It resumed the US trial of the experimental vaccine after approval by US regulators, the company said on Friday.Staff at a London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, The Sun newspaper reported on Monday."
"Narendra Modi: Think of troops at borders, light a ‘diya’ for them",,"NEW DELHI: At a time when India and China are facing off on the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday exhorted people to light a ‘diya’ in their homes in support of security forces guarding India’s borders.“We must also think of our braveheart soldiers who are firmly stationed on our borders in the line of duty, even during these festive times, all in the service and security of Mother India. We have to light a ‘diya’ (lamp) at home in honour of these brave sons and daughters of Mother India,” Modi said.In his monthly radio address Mann ki Baat ’, Modi also made a strong pitch for unity. “Unity is power, unity is strength, unity is progress, unity is empowerment, united we will scale new heights,” he said.The PM also said India has repeatedly thwarted efforts of those who have sought to divide the country.Promoting ‘Vocal for Local’ while shopping during the festival season, the PM said people should make an effort to involve sanitation workers, security guards, domestic helps and other service staff in family celebrations to send out a message that their services are valued. He also sought people’s engagement in the government’s ‘Ek Bharat-Shrestha Bharat’ by contributing information about India’s rich tradition of local cuisines, spices and indigenous ingredients.In light of the coronavirus pandemic , the PM emphasised the need for care and caution during the festival season and asked people to remain patient and follow health guidelines.During his radio broadcast, Modi also lauded Pon Mariyappan from Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu for converting a small portion of his hair cutting salon into a library, and hailed similar mobile library initiatives in UP and Arunachal Pradesh."

BLOG | SCORECARD

Kings XI Punjab beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 8 wickets

Mandeep Singh (KXIP):

This was very special. My father always used to tell me to remain not out in every game, definitely special. He always used to tell me, whether you score 100 or 200, you should be not out. I had a talk with Rahul before the start of the game. Last game I was trying to score quicker and I wasn't comfortable doing that. I told Rahul if I play my normal game, I will win the game and I had the belief. He (Rahul) told me to back my game and play the way I want to play, pretty happy with the win. He (Gayle) was just telling me to keep batting and play till the end and I just told him that he should never retire. He is too good. We are very excited.

Eoin Morgan (KKR) :

Particularly here at Sharjah, you have to counterattack if you lose early wickets, and identify the wicket early. Disappointed with the partnerships, thought we could have scored more (runs). When we were three down, we wanted a partnership going. Around 180-190 would have been a good score, but we kept losing wickets. That's one of the challenges this year, going from ground to ground. Hopefully we adjust to the conditions in Dubai. That's the nature of the tournament, there are not many bad sides. Our fate is in our own hands in the last two games. I think Gill scoring runs and restricting the Kings till the 11th or 12th over, those were the positives.

TEAM CHANGES: Both the teams are unchanged.

CAPTAINS' TAKE:

Eoin Morgan (KKR):

We would have bowled as well, pretty much for the same reasons. We did well against DC, played the way we wanted. Our fate is still in our hands, that's good. We have depended a lot on match-ups, it works at times, it doesn't at times. Andre Russell is unfortunately still not fit, so same team

KL Rahul (KXIP):

We will bowl first. Like to have a target on the board, the dew might have an effect as well in the second innings. Winning gives a lot of confidence to the group, it makes them keep performing better and better. The back-room staff have been phenomenal right from even the tournament started. No changes to our team

PLAYING XIs:

Kolkata Knight Riders: Shubman Gill, Nitish Rana, Rahul Tripathi, Dinesh Karthik(w), Eoin Morgan(c), Sunil Narine, Pat Cummins, Lockie Ferguson, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Prasidh Krishna, Varun Chakravarthy

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Calls to boycott French goods are growing in the Arab world and beyond after President Emmanuel vowed not to ""give up cartoons"" depicting the Prophet Mohammad.France has urged for an end to such calls, saying such attacks were the work of a “radical minority"".Macron's comments, on Wednesday, came in response to the beheading of a teacher, Samuel Paty, outside his school in a suburb outside Paris earlier this month, after he had shown cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed during a class he was leading on free speech.On October 17, a French teacher who had recently shown students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed was beheaded outside his school, in what President Emmanuel Macron called an ""Islamist terrorist attack"".The assailant, whose identity has not been established, was shot by police as they tried to arrest him and later died of his injuries, police said.In a homage to teacher Samuel Paty, Macron said that France will not give up cartoons. Macron said Paty was killed ""because he incarnated the Republic.""He added, ""He was killed because Islamists want our future,"" while vowing ""they will never have it.""Macron's comments on Prophet's cartoons were strongly condemned by the Muslim leaders across the world.Muslims see any depiction of the Prophet as blasphemous.Macron's support to the publishing of cartoons has invited the ire of the Arab world where Muslims have called for the boycott of the French products . Such boycotts are already underway in Kuwait and Qatar.Social media platforms are also abuzz with such posters calling for the boycott of products from France.In Kuwait, the non-governmental Union of Consumer Co-operative Societies, which groups more than 70 establishments, issued the boycott directive in an Oct. 23 circular. Several co-ops visited by Reuters on Sunday had cleared the shelves of items such as hair and beauty products made by French companies.Dozens of Kuwaiti stores are boycotting French products, with images on social media showing workers removing French Kiri and Babybel processed cheese from shelves.In Doha, an AFP correspondent saw workers stripping shelves of French-made St. Dalfour jams and Saf-Instant yeast in a branch of the Al Meera supermarket chain on Saturday.Al Meera competes with French supermarket chains Monoprix and Carrefour for market share in the lucrative Qatari grocery sector. Al Meera and another grocery operator, Souq Al Baladi, released statements late Friday saying they would pull French products from stores until further notice.In another incidence, Qatar University wrote on Twitter that following ""the deliberate abuse of Islam and its symbols"", French Cultural Week would be postponed indefinitely, in a context where 2020 is the France-Qatar year of culture.Anger at Macron has also spilt over into the streets in several Muslim-majority countries. Demonstrators held protests Sunday in regions of war-torn Syria still outside government control and burnt pictures of Macron, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.Around 70 people protested in the Libyan capital Tripoli, an AFP correspondent said. Some set fire to French flags and stamped on pictures of the French president.In Deir al-Balah in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians burnt portraits of Macron, calling his remarks ""an attack and an insult against Islam.""In Lebanon, pro-Iran Shiite movement Hezbollah condemned the ""deliberate insult"" to the Prophet.In Iraq, Rabaa Allah, a powerful pro-Iran armed faction, said in a statement that one and a half billion people worldwide had in effect been insulted, and warned that its men were ""ready to respond when and where they want"".Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan attacked his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, saying he needed mental treatment over his attitude towards Muslims and Islam.""What else can be said to a head of state who does not understand freedom of belief and who behaves in this way to millions of people living in his country who are members of a different faith?"" Erdogan said.The Turkish president said on October 6 after Macron's initial comments on ""Islamist separatism"", that the remarks were ""a clear provocation"" and showed the French leader's ""impertinence"".Kuwait's foreign minister, who met the French ambassador on Sunday, condemned the French teacher's killing as a horrendous crime but stressed the need to avoid insulting religion in official and political remarks that ""inflame hatred, enmity and racism"".The 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, headquartered in Saudi Arabia, last week condemned the “ongoing practice of running satirical caricatures depicting the Prophet Muhammad” and “will continue to decry justification for blasphemy of any religion in the name of freedom of expression.”Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan accused French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday of ""attacking Islam"", after the European leader criticised Islamists and defended the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed.In a series of tweets, Khan said the remark would sow division.""This is a time when Pres Macron could have put healing touch & denied space to extremists rather than creating further polarisation & marginalisation that inevitably leads to radicalisation,"" Khan wrote.""It is unfortunate that he has chosen to encourage Islamophobia by attacking Islam rather than the terrorists who carry out violence, be it Muslims, White Supremacists or Nazi ideologists.""Morocco's foreign ministry said on Sunday that the continuing publication of ""offensive"" cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad is an act of provocation.While condemning savage acts perpetrated in the name of Islam, ""Morocco denounces these provocations offending the sacredness of the Islamic religion,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.Jordan's Islamic affairs minister Mohammed al-Khalayleh said that ""insulting"" prophets was ""not an issue of personal freedom but a crime that encourages violence.""French authorities have denounced the ""propaganda"" against France that they said was aimed at fanning hate at home and abroad. The foreign ministry described some social media calls for protests as ""heinous"", lamenting manipulations ""by a radical minority"" and dubbing nascent boycotts of French goods ""groundless"".The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday evening that its diplomats were mobilizing to ask countries where boycotts were being organized or hate calls issued not to back them, and to provide assurances that French citizens would be safe.""In numerous countries of the Middle East, calls to boycott French products...and more generally, calls to demonstrate against France, in sometimes hateful terms, have been relayed on social media,"" the French foreign ministry said. It added that such calls ""denature"" France's positions on freedom of expression and conscience.While Turkish President Erdigan has doubled down on Macron, France announced on Saturday that it was recalling its ambassador for consultations amid the call for boycott of French products.In a chain of back-and-forth communications, quickly rising temperatures and French concern over the ramifications of its policies on free expression, Macron tweeted on Sunday night, in English and Arabic, ""We will not give in, ever."" But he also affirmed, ""We respect all difference in a spirit of peace.""""We do not accept hate speech and... will always be on the side of human dignity and universal values,"" he added.Another presidential tweet said in bold print: ""We are ONE."""

Dussehra is one of the major festivals which holds special significance for the Hindu community. It marks the end of Navratri, the nine-day festival celebrated to honour Goddess Durga and her nine avatars. Dussehra, also fondly known as Vijayadashmi falls on the tenth day of the festival. This year, it will be celebrated on October 25, 2020, which is a Sunday.The word, Dussehra has Sanskrit origins, made up of two words- 'Dasha' symbolizing the ten heads, and 'hara', which means defeat.Historically, Dussehra is also symbolic of good over evil. It is on the day of Vijayadashmi that Lord Rama defeated the evil king Ravana. Dussehra is also a remembrance of the noble act when Goddess Durga killed demon Mahishasura and saved humanity. Some ancient texts also mention that Lord Rama worshipped Goddess Durga before going to war against Ravana on the advice of Lord Vishnu.Hence, in their honour, and to remember the triumph of good over evil, special pujas, yagnas and havans are organised to educate one another, that true worth and laurels always have a precedent over evil acts. Plays are staged, and effigies of the demon king, Ravana are burned at Ramleelas. In the eastern part of the country, where Goddess Durga is worshipped, the day marks the end of Durga Puja and the idol is immersed in holy water. While Dussehra marks the end of Navratras, it also marks the ushering in of Diwali, which falls 20 days after Dussehra.While the pandemic has definitely lulled the glimmer on the festive spirit, there's no reason to not wish your near and dear ones, and spread good thoughts. We present to you some of the best wishes, messages and quotes to share with your loved ones on the occasion of Dussehra. These can also be shared on social media.Here's wishing you all a happy and prosperous Dussehra!"

Bimal Gurung: Who is Bimal Gurung? Why is he in the news? What is the Gorkhaland issue?,,"FILE: Bimal Gurung. ANI

KOLKATA: Bimal Gurung is in the news these days. As Darjeeling witnesses rallies in support of him as well as against (him), we will explain what the Gorkhanland issue is and who he is.

Bimal Gurung is one of the founders of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM). He was the chairperson of Gorkhaland Territorial Administration that governs the hilly areas - Darjeeling district and terai - in West Bengal.

GJM has been demanding the formation of a separate state of Gorkhaland within India.

Why is Gurung in the news?

Gurung had made a dramatic reappearance in Kolkata on October 21. Last week, Gurung and his GJM quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and allied with Trinamool Congress before the upcoming 2021 assembly election. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had won seven seats in north Bengal in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The recent development might upset calculations of the poll pundits ahead of the elections.

Darjeeling hills have witnessed rallies by Gurung supporters and detractors welcoming him and opposing his return respectively, days after the erstwhile GJM supremo surfaced in Kolkata after being in hiding for three years.

While the GJM Gurung faction has demanded that he be allowed to return immediately, the Binay Tamang (faction) of the hill party, currently in political control of the Darjeeling hills, claims that Gurung''s return meant reverting to violence.

Gurung, who along with his close aides are lodged in a hotel in Kolkata, is watching the situation closely.

Gurung is expecting the state government to drop charges of murder and UAPA against him.

Gurung has been in hiding since 2017 for fear of being arrested.

More than 140 cases were lodged against Gurung during the 104-day prolonged agitation in the Darjeeling hills over the separate statehood demand in 2017.

Bimal Gurung, who was earlier a Gorkha Volunteers Corps member, fought for the creation of a Gorkhaland state during 1986-1988 under the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF). He was a close aide of Subhash Ghisingh, the leader of GNLF and chairman of Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. Later, he turned against Ghisingh to launch the second agitation for a Gorkhaland state.

The Gorkhaland issue

The Darjeeling hills had repeatedly witnessed violent agitation over the demand for a separate state for over three decades. In June 2017, when the Hills saw a 104-day-long strike over the issue, the same led to a split in the GJM, with Binay Tamang, who was once a deputy to Gurung, taking over the reins of the party and expelling its chief. Although the GJM faction, led by Gurung had then kept up its support to the BJP, the Tamang faction had joined hands with the TMC of Mamata Banerjee.

The ruling TMC in the state is in talks with the Binay Tamang faction of GJM to ensure that the two groups join hands in the hills, a senior leader of Mamata Banerjee's party privy to the development said.

The demand of the formation of a Gorkhaland state comprises the Darjeeling district and many areas of the Dooars. The total area of the proposed state is 6450 square kilometre and comprises Banarhat, Bhaktinagar, Birpara, Chalsa, Darjeeling, Jaigaon, Kalchini, Kalimpong, Kumargram, Kurseong, Madarihat, Malbazar, Mirik and Nagarkatta.

IPL 2020 Playoffs: Here are each IPL team's chances of making it to the last four,,"1. The maximum any team can reach this season in the league stage is 20 points

2. Only three teams can reach this –

Mumbai Indians

,

Delhi Capitals

and

Royal Challengers Bangalore

3. If one of these three teams gets to 20 points, the other two can’t

4. With 11 games in all left to be played in the league stage, there are 2,048 possible combinations of match outcomes (not counting washouts)

5. In 512 of these possible combinations, Chennai Super Kings get to 12 points. In none of them, however, can they qualify since at least four teams will get to 14 or more points

6. Chennai are therefore out of contention even if they win all their remaining games

7.

Rajasthan Royals

are only slightly better off. If they lose even one of their remaining two games, they cannot qualify. If they win both, they have a 9% chance of being tied on points for fourth place (48 out of 512 possible outcomes)

8. Sunrisers Hyderabad’s chances of qualifying for the play-offs also remain slim even if they win their remaining three games. If they do that, they have a 10% chance of being tied for fourth place (26 out of 256 possible outcomes)

9. Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore have a 95% chance of qualifying

10. The chances of any of these teams failing to qualify because they can’t even make joint fourth spot is a mere 0.4%. The probability of any of them ending up in tied fourth place is 4.7%

11. Kolkata Knight Riders and Kings XI are therefore the most likely contenders for the fourth spot

12. There is a very slim chance (0.4%) of KKR finishing clearly at the top with 18 points. It has a 6% chance of tying for first place

13. Kings XI has no chance of being a clear No.1, but there is a slim chance (0.4%) of it being tied for first place

With Chennai Super Kings clearly out of the race, what exactly are the chances of the remaining seven teams to make it to the playoffs? TOI's Shankar Raghuraman does the number crunching to arrive at these 13 points.The IPL 2020 season has been a very competitive one. With a team like Kings XI Punjab rising from the ashes after languishing at the bottom of the points table, thanks to four wins on the trot, things have become more interesting. The three break away teams this season have been Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore. Mumbai and Bangalore though both lost over the weekend. With seven teams in the running for the four play-offs berths and three teams (Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore) more than likely to seal a spot, the fight for the remaining fourth place (for which KKR and KXIP are the prime contenders as of now) could make the remaining league matches of IPL 2020 very interesting. Expect the teams to throw everything, including the kitchen sink to try and grab a play-off berth in the matches coming up."

SHARJAH: Chris Gayle channelised his inner anger while Mandeep Singh played through immense personal grief as they conjured to script another chapter in a beautiful comeback story for Kings XI Punjab which beat Kolkata Knight Riders by eight wickets in the IPL on Monday.Chasing a target of 150, KXIP achieved the target in 18.5 overs losing only two wickets as they have now won their fifth successive match to keep play-off hopes alive.Gayle, who was overlooked and was also ill during the first phase showed why he is the 'Universe Boss' during his innings of 51 off 29 balls with five sixes. Mandeep, who is grieving the loss of his father, anchored the chase with an unbeaten 66 off 56 balls as the duo added 100 runs in 10.1 overs.Such was the effect of Gayle-storm that it rubbed off on Mandeep (8x4, 2x6) who also completed a splendid sixth IPL half-century.IPL scheduleThe duo added 100 runs from 61 balls to take them home with seven balls to spare.KXIP's dream run of five wins on the bounce not only took them to top-four but also opened up the table before the penultimate round.KKR slipped to fifth with 12 points from 12 matches as with a negative run rate of (-0.479) things have become more difficult to make the last-four.Opting to field, Kings XI Punjab dished out a disciplined bowling show, especially at the back-end, to restrict Kolkata Knight Riders to a modest 149/9.Mohammed Shami (3/35) was the pick of the Kings XI Punjab bowlers while leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (2/20) and Chris Jordan (2/25) claimed two wickets apiece to put brakes on KKR who were invited to bat first.After a familiar jittery start, KKR got the momentum going with opener Shubman Gill (57 off 45 balls) and skipper Eoin Morgan (40) firing all cylinders inside the Powerplay.But KXIP's last match hero Jordan pulled things back for his team by brilliantly mixing up his slow deliveries, while Bishnoi took the prized scalp of Morgan after KKR reached 54/3 inside the Powerplay.Morgan holed out to Murugan Ashwin at deep square leg as Bishoi ended the freeflowing partnership for 81 runs from 47 balls and from then onwards KKR struggled to get going.Earlier, KKR had another messy start and looked in deep trouble at 10/3 inside two overs after Shami's exceptional first over.But Morgan and Gill counter-attacked beautifully, getting the boundaries and sixes. The duo made full use of the Powerplay restrictions and Shami conceded 21 runs from his third over.Gill showed his sheer class and timing, smacking Shami for back-to-back sixes.This was after opener Nitish Rana got out for a golden duck and Shami dismissing Rahul Tripathi (7) and Dinesh Karthik (0) in the space of three balls."
CONMEBOL planning to allow fans into next year's Copa America,,"BUENOS AIRES: The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) is making plans to hold next year's Copa America in stadiums filled with fans if a vaccine is found in time, one of the senior members of the organization told Reuters on Monday.The tournament, set to be held in June and July 2021 in Argentina and Colombia, was held over from this year due to the pandemic but officials said they are optimistic fans will be able to attend what is one of the region's biggest sporting events.""The projection is to realize a Copa America with full stadiums if a vaccine is found for the coronavirus ,"" Gonzalo Belloso , CONMEBOL's development director, told Reuters in a phone interview.""If that's not possible we are also working with the possibility of stadiums that are at 30%-40% of capacity.""Belloso said a final decision will rest with the host nations.The next Copa America is the first to be held in two countries and will take place between June 11 and July 10."
Klopp proud of Liverpool form amid Van Dijk absence,,"Jurgen Klopp. (AP Photo)

LIVERPOOL: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has praised his team for their form without Virgil van Dijk .

The Premier League champions managed to beat both Dutch giants Ajax and Sheffield United last week despite missing star central defender van Dijk, who is set to be sidelined for several months recovering from knee surgery following a brutal challenge by Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during the Merseyside derby on October 17.

Fabinho, a midfielder, has found himself covering for the Dutchman alongside Joe Gomez and Klopp believes Liverpool are getting by as well as could be hoped in the absence of the ""best defender in the world.""

""Every team in the world would miss Virgil van Dijk,"" said Klopp on Monday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Liverpool's Champions League group match at home to Midtjylland.

""He is the best in the world. You play a game, he gets injured, and you play three days later so of course that's difficult to do because all the boys played together with him and we didn't have long for them to get used to playing without him.""

The Reds boss added: ""Fabinho, who normally plays as a six, has had to come in and play with Joe. For that we did pretty well and that will get better 100 percent because unfortunately everything in life takes time and defending takes time.

""They all played with Virgil at some point but not many times did they play together with each other so we do not expect perfection -- but not too far away from perfection.

""Everyone needs time to replace a massive person or player, Virgil is the best defender in the world and so far we've done pretty well.""

Tuesday's Group D match at Anfield sees six-time European kings Liverpool, who will also be without the injured trio of Joel Matip, Naby Keita and Thiago Alcantara, up against Champions League newcomers Midtjylland, who made their tournament debut during a 4-0 home defeat by Atalanta last week.

Danish club Midtjylland were only founded in 1999 but Klopp downplayed suggestions of a 'David against Goliath' fixture.

""We don't see Midtjylland as a small club, we see Midtjylland as a proper challenger in this group,"" he said.

""No-one is part of the Champions League because they are nice cities, they are in the Champions League because they earned the right the year before.""

""There are no small teams in the Champions League, there are only teams who show how big they are on the pitch, not in the press conferences before games.

""The 4-0 against Atalanta was not a 4-0 - it was because the score was 4-0 but Midtjylland were in the game. Tomorrow it will be a real challenge and we have to be ready for it, and we will try to be.""

Soccer star becomes first woman to coach a men's pro team in Egypt,,"Faiza Heidar. (Twitter Photo)

GIZA (Egypt): Faiza Heidar grew up playing soccer in the streets with the boys and went on to captain Egypt's national women's team . Now she has become the first woman to train one of the country's professional men's clubs.

Heidar has been signed up by the fourth division side Ideal Goldi, based in Giza.

""There is usually some mockery at the beginning,"" the 36-year-old told Reuters.

""But then they realise that they will learn something, that they will develop their skills.""

She said she was the first Egyptian coach - male or female - to gain the Premier Skills Coach Educator status, certified by England's Premier League.

Soccer remains an overwhelmingly male sport in Egypt.

""I would tell her not to go. She would say: 'No, I will go.' She loved the sport,"" said Heidar's mother, Khodra Abdelrahman.

""I let her go and prayed that God help her. And she did go, and she has done so well.""

Impressed with Varun Chakravarthy's performance: Sachin Tendulkar,,"MUMBAI: Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar showered praise on Varun Chakravarthy, who on Monday earned his maiden India call-up for T20 Internationals against Australia, saying he has been impressed by the mystery spinner's variations and calm head during the ongoing IPL in the UAE.“Varun has been bowling well throughout this tournament (IPL). And very rarely he has given a little more runs at this level,"" Tendulkar said in a video shared on 100MB.""... what happens is everybody is seeing how Sunil Narine will bowl, so normally when Narine bowls, there is more pressure on the bowler from the other end and the batsman tries to attack him more.""The 29-year-old Chennai born Chakravarthy, who plays for Kolkata Knight Riders , has picked up 12 wickets to be the leading wicket-taker for his side. He has also picked up the first five-for of this IPL. In domestic circuit, he plays for Tamil Nadu.According to Tendulkar, Chakravarthy has not rattled despite bowling most of the times in pressure situations.“Varun has been extremely successful and the variation which I am seeing, the confidence which I am seeing, he is able to disguise the balls, googlies,” said Tendulkar, who holds numerous records to his name.“He has been a consistent performer and I am impressed with his performance because he has bowled in many pressure situations and he has not been rattled in those situations. He looked pretty balanced and confident,” said the batting maestro.According to Tendulkar, if a bowler has confidence in his abilities and clarity in mind, then 30-40 per cent of the battle is won.""When you are on the run-up, there are several things going in mind … if you are confident and sure of what you have to execute, then the bowler's challenge reduces a bit.""Of course the ball has to be bowled from the crease, but your body follows exactly what your mind is thinking,"" said Tendulkar."
Professional Fighters League set for India foray in early 2021,,"MMA fans enjoy the PFL Championship bout at Madison Square Garden, New York.

JAIPUR: Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) in India is set to receive a huge boost next year as the world’s second-largest MMA league — the Professional Fighters League (PFL) — will stage its International Qualifier Series in second half of 2021 to help talented Indian fighters join its roster and battle it out in the cage for a million-dollar top prize in the United States of America (USA).

There have been attempts in the past to create a city-based MMA league like the Super Fight League (SFL) which was backed by British boxer Amir Khan and his partner Bill Dosanjh . But it fizzled out after a blockbuster inaugural season due to lack of advertiser/sponsor interest. ONE Championship too attempted a similar initiative of having an India leg but failed. They seem pretty content with signing few Indians like Ritu Phogat on their roster. Surely, PFL would have done their homework before entering the Indian market...

Even before the international qualifiers, the PFL will organise open workout sessions pre-season throughout the country, which will also double up as a tryout for Indian players, with former World Champion and President (Fighter Operations) Ray Sefo in early next year, dates of which are yet to be finalised keeping in mind the travel restrictions imposed due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The regular PFL season is scheduled to begin on April 23.

To motivate the native fighters further, the PFL signed a TV deal last month with Eurosport India, which will broadcast live PFL regular season, playoffs and championship events. The programming will also feature classic fights from PFL’s vault, including but not limited to the championship journeys of stars such as Kayla Harrison, Ray Cooper III, Emiliano Sordi, Magomed Magomedkerimov and Nathan Schulte

This will be a great opportunity for pugilists and wrestlers, who want to explore other forms of professional combat sports like kickboxing, Muay Thai and Jiu-Jitsu, to showcase their skills. Martial art forms like Judo, Karate, Kung Fu and Taekwondo are already popular in India with Bollywood movies playing a major role in promoting it through action sequences.

Further, martial arts also became a key component for propagating self-defence among school children, especially girls, in the backdrop of growing crime against women. It’s in this scenario that MMA instils a sense of empowerment and PFL Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Peter Murray sees huge potential for the sport’s growth in the sub-continent.

Murray, who brings with him over 20 years of experience in sports marketing, talent management and content development, has a keen eye for spotting talent and proven track record of attracting stars, something which he is doing with PFL too. Murray has already got boxing great Mike Tyson and Hollywood actor Kevin Hart associated with the PFL and many big names are in the pipeline.

Prior to becoming the top boss at PFL, Murray was instrumental in signing three-time NBA champion Stephen Curry, two-division UFC champion Georges St-Pierre, heavyweight boxing world champion Anthony Joshua, and multiple-time gold medalist swimmer Michael Phelps at American sportswear brand Under Armour, where he was working as Vice President, Global Brand & Sports Marketing.

In an exclusive chat with The Times of India, PFL Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Peter Murray talks about the reason behind bringing the MMA league to India, how tech innovation has catalysed its popularity and what can MMA fans can look forward to in 2021. Excerpts from the interview:

You had to postpone the regular 2020 season due to Covid-19. What are you looking forward to in the 2021 season?

While we made the decision to postpone the 2020 season, we did not stay still. It was important for us to continue the positive momentum from 2019 - Domestic linear viewing audience was up 50%, our pinnacle Championship event increased by 96%, our digital audience 30%. Interest in the PFL was at an all-time high, and it was critical that we engage our fan base. We launched PFL Studios, a fully integrated global media division of the Professional Fighters League producing original MMA content for all platforms including television, digital and mobile. We also rolled out our first OTT Platform, delivering hundreds of hours of premium PFL content to fans worldwide, accessible at their fingertips. We also increased distribution, through international and domestic partners, Eurosport India included. So we provided our fans with the content they crave. We believe 2021 will be our biggest season yet. Our champions and top contenders are returning, and we’ve signed a crop of exciting new fighters who will surely be in championship contention. We’ve also expanded our SmartCage Technology, adding kick speed for 2021. We’ll incorporate gaming and betting into the viewing experience. Most of all, we’re looking forward to the action beginning April 23rd.

You have an eye for both identifying talent and attracting big names. How do you do that?

To attract top talent, there needs to be belief in the product. MMA is the fastest growing sport in the world, and PFL offers an innovative and differentiated experience. We are leading the next evolution of the sport, and are working tirelessly to change the game. The opportunity to be a part of that is enticing.

Who are the big MMA stars that are competing in the PFL? Do star names help in popularising a league/championship?

PFL’s season format is designed to create and attract stars. Kayla Harrison is a top-5 women’s MMA talent. She is a 2-time Olympic Judo Gold Medalist, and is undefeated in the cage. She made history by becoming the first Women’s Lightweight Champion and will be looking to repeat in 2021. Ray Cooper III is one of the most dangerous fighters in the league, a top welterweight with knockout power. Emiliano Sordi made history by becoming the first Argentinean MMA champion. He was undefeated last season with all wins coming by early stoppage. And then we’re all excited to see Rory MacDonald in the PFL cage. His resume speaks for itself, he’ll go down in history as one of the greats and the best is yet to come with him. Star power is important, but equally important is making sure every fight means something. And in the PFL, every fight, every round counts. Whoever raised the belt at the end of the season is one of the best in the world.

What is the big difference between UFC and PFL?

There is room at the top for another MMA leader and PFL has established itself as the #2 MMA organization in the world. We are the only MMA organization with a true sport season format, and the only organization in combat with proprietary SmartCage technology. We lead with innovation, we are not a me too product.

We are aware that you are planning to expand PFL to India. What made you decide this as Indians are not into full-time professional MMA?

As the second-largest populated country in the world, there is tremendous growth opportunity in India for the Professional Fighters League and MMA. We are actively evaluating talent in the region for opportunities to join the PFL roster and compete for a million-dollar prize. Our exciting partnership with Eurosport India provides fans with access to premium MMA content. Combined with an increased presence in India, PFL can serve as a catalyst for extending the reach of this sport beyond the over 450 million MMA fans around the world

How will the International Qualifier Series (IQS) work? What is in it for Indians?

This year’s International Qualifier Series was impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic. We look forward to bringing the IQS back in the near future, and continuing to grow the platform. The IQS is an opportunity for international talent to compete and earn a spot in the PFL. We partner with top regional MMA promotions and hold a tournament, where the winner in each market is considered for a PFL contract.

We believe there is demand for premium MMA content in India, which really spearheaded our partnership with Eurosport. The IQS is a platform, an opportunity for fighters to earn a contract with the PFL. And once on the PFL roster, every fighter has an equal shot at a title and million dollar prize.

Rahul Gandhi: EC orders FIR against Rahul Gandhi for TV interview on Gujarat poll eve,,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday ordered filing of an FIR against Congress president Rahul Gandhi for giving an interview to a TV channel in Gujarat in violation of the 48-hour ban on campaigning, as well as against all TV channels that telecast the interview across districts going to the polls on Thursday.The EC, in a notice sent to Rahul Gandhi, said that the interview fell within the definition of ""election matter"" under Section 126(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the display of which ""within 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for conclusion of poll, amounts to violation of the prohibition contained in Section 126(1)(b) of R P Act"". It further said that the Congress chief, by giving such interview and its display on TV channels on Wednesday, had ""prima facie violated...provisions of para 1(4) of the model code of conduct, Section 126(1)(b) of the R P Act and Election Commission's lawful instructions in this regard"".While seeking an explanation from Rahul Gandhi for violation of the model code latest by December 18, the EC separately issued a direction to the Gujarat chief electoral officer asking him to initiate action against all those who had violated the aforesaid provisions.""The Commission hereby directs that necessary action for violation of the aforesaid Section 126(1)(b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, may be initiated by filing of FIR against those who have violated the above-mentioned provisions immediately in areas which are going to the poll tomorrow, i.e, 14th December, 2017,"" EC said in a communication to the Gujarat CEO.An EC official confirmed to TOI that the term ""those"" in the above paragraph was in reference to both the TV channels that aired Rahul Gandhi's interview in the poll-bound districts as well as Rahul Gandhi himself.This is made clear by the notice served on Rahul Gandhi, where EC says that ""by giving such interview and its display on TV channels on 13.12.2017, you have, prima facie, violated...para 1(4) of the model code of conduct, Section 126(1)(b) of the R P Act, 1951, and Election Commission's lawful instructions in this regard.""As per Para 1(4) of model code, all parties and candidates must avoid scrupulously all activities which are 'offences' under the election law. Further, Section 126(1)(b) of R P Act prohibits display to the public of any 'election matter' on TV, during period of 48 hours ending with hour fixed for conclusion of poll.As per EC instructions brought to the notice of all registered national parties, ""no matter related to election can be shown or displayed in theatres, TV channels or electronic media during the said period of 48 hours"".The Commission on Wednesday said it had received reports and complaints that some TV channels had displayed interview given by the Congress president where he is talking about Gujarat elections. Terming telecast of interview as “display of election matter” in violation of the 48-hour ban in force for Phase-2 polling, the Election Commission on Wednesday directed the state chief electoral officer to initiate filing of an FIR against the said channels as well as Rahul Gandhi under Section 126(1)(b) of Representation of the People Act (R P Act), 1951.The Commission also asked the TV channels “which are violating the provision of Section 126(1)(b) by displaying said election matter in Phase 2 districts in Gujarat to forthwith stop the display of such matter”."
Subhash Chandra Bose: File that could solve Bose’s death mystery ‘closed for 100 years’,,"CHENNAI: A request made by Paris-based historian JBP More for access to a secret file of the French military authorities, which may unravel the mystery behind the death of Subhas Chandra Bose, was refused by the French national archival authorities recently. They said the file was closed for 100 years.

“After years of research, I can confirm that Bose’s life ended in Saigon, most probably at Vietnam’s Bot Catinat prison, on the basis of the French secret service records,” he said. “The letter of the French authorities not to allow me to consult a lone file pertaining to the INA and Bose in Saigon has come as a great surprise to me. This goes to affirm my conviction that Bose’s life ended in Saigon sometime in September 1945. That is why this file has been classified as out of reach for consultation for 100 years,” said More, who teaches at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Economiques et Commerciales, Paris.

More said it is now up to the concerned people or the Indian authorities to demand the French to open up this lone file that is withheld from the public for 100 years. “This file must contain information about the last days of Bose,” said More.

In July, based on a French secret service report dated December 11, 1947 at the National Archives of France, More had come up with a finding that Bose didn’t die in an air crash .

“It seems quite certain that Bose did not die in the air crash off Taipei as popularly believed. If he had died there, then Bose’s ashes kept in Tokyo needs to undergo DNA test to confirm that it was really Bose who had died in the air crash. Since this test was never done, one could reasonably hold that the ashes did not belong to Bose,” he said.

Besides, other stories had been planted on and off that Bose escaped to Russia or China. According to More, these stories have been floated by vested interests to cover up the fact that Bose was arrested in Saigon after 17th August 1945.

“This has been attested by the French secret service records. So at this juncture, one can assert without hesitation that Bose’s life journey had ended sometime in September 1945 in Saigon/HO Chi Minh city, most probably at Bot Catinat prison or somewhere else in the most tragic way,” he said.

A report filed by French captain Pauwels, who was chief of police in Saigon after August 1945, is crucial in this case. “The arrest of Bose and some of his Saigon associates was made under the orders and supervision of Captain Pauwels and they were incarcerated at Bot Catinat prison, which was the dreaded principal colonial prison,” said More, quoting Note Verbale of Capitaine Pauwels, chief of police services, Saigon dated 26 January 1946.

Read this story in Marathi

NEW DELHI: A controversy broke out on Wednesday over Rahul Gandhi 's visit to Gujarat's famed Somnath temple , after his name was reportedly listed in the register of non-Hindu visitors.Congress party's media coordinator Manoj Tyagi made the alleged goof-up on Wednesday when Rahul Gandhi was paying a visit to the Somnath temple ahead of a two-day campaign tour in the poll-bound state. While writing the name of Congress MP Ahmed Patel, who was also part of Rahul's entourage, in the special register for non-Hindus visiting the temple, Tyagi also jotted down the Congress vice-president's name.A famous pilgrim place of Lord Shiva, the Somnath temple is barred to non-Hindus, who must obtain permission from the temple authorities to enter the sacred place.While Rahul offered prayers at the Somnath temple earlier this afternoon, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was addressing a public rally at Prachi, a town barely 25 kms away from the temple.Taking a swipe at Rahul for his stopover at Somnath temple, PM Modi remarked that his great-grandfather and India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had been opposed to the building of the shrine.""Today some people are remembering Somnath, I have to ask them - Have you forgotten your history? Your family members, our first Prime Minister, was not happy with the idea of abeing built there,"" PM Modi said at a rally in nearby Prachi.The ancient temple was already the cynosure of media attention owing to the high profile campaign rallies scheduled in its vicinity on Wednesday. At such a time, Tyagi's flub was posted on social media, where it went viral. 'Somnath temple' quickly rose to the list of top trends on micro-blogging site Twitter.Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia dismissed the incident as a storm in a teacup and panned the BJP for questioning Rahul's faith over the matter, while also insisting that Rahul Gandhi was unaware of the error.""Rahul Gandhi did puja as a Hindu in Somanth temple. When his media coordinator wrote down Ahmed Patel's name in the special register, temple authorities asked who will be accompanying Ahmedbhai. So he wrote down Rahul ji's name. Rahul ji was not even aware of such an entry in any register,"" Modhwadia told TOI.The Congress party's official Twitter handle later issued a clarification stating that Rahul only signed the temple's visitors book and the other images being circulated were ""fabricated"".""Rahul ji doesn't require the BJP's certificate for his faith. The BJP has been exposed on their so called development claims so now they're trying to divert people's attention by raising such non issues,"" Modhwadia added.The temple administration said Rahul's name was written in the shrine's register for non-Hindus by his media coordinator and maintained none of its staff was involved in the entire episode, reported PTI.Rahul's visit to the Somnath temple is the latest in a long line of temple tours over the last few weeks as part of his Gujarat Navsarjan Yatra . The Gandhi scion has faced fire from the BJP for these pilgrimages, which the saffron party claims are a pre-poll stunt to garner votes.Both the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi are on a campaign blitzkrieg in Gujarat , which goes to polls in two phases on December 9 and 14."
"Air India: Woman passenger, Air India duty manager slap each other at Delhi IGI airport",,"Ahmedabad-bound woman passenger had an argument with Air India official. (Representative image)

NEW DELHI: A woman passenger and an Air India duty manager slapped each other at the Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday morning after she was denied boarding for reporting late, police said.

The incident took place after the Ahmedabad-bound woman passenger had an argument with the official.

""A lady passenger was told by a counter staff that she will not be able to check in because she was late for the flight. This led to an argument and the staff directed her to the duty manager who was also a lady and there was an altercation,"" an Air India spokesperson said.

Sources in the airline said the passenger allegedly slapped the duty manager.

The duty manager also hit back, DCP, Airport, Sanjay Bhatia said.

""Arguments started between the passenger and Air India lady staff and the passenger slapped her. Lady staff in retaliation also slapped her,"" Bhatia said.

The passenger later called the police and went to the police station.

Both the passenger and the Air India staff later apologised to each other and the issue was amicably resolved, the spokesperson added.

India stands with Egypt: PM Modi condemns mosque attack

CAIRO: At least 235 worshippers were killed and 109 others injured when heavily-armed terrorists bombed a mosque and opened fire on people attending Friday prayers in Egypt's restive North Sinai region, in the deadliest terror attack in the country.The terrorists launched a targeted bomb and gun attack on the al-Rowda mosque in Al-Arish city during the Friday prayers, the state-run MENA news agency reported.After the bomb ripped through the mosque, the gunmen on four off-road vehicles opened fire on the worshippers who tried to escape from the site after the explosion, it said.At least 235 worshippers were killed and 109 others injured in the attack, Ahram Online said.Pictures from the scene show rows of bloodied victims inside the mosque.The blasts from improvised explosive devices caused considerable damage to the mosque, the website added.Speaking to state-run Masriya TV station, Egyptian health ministry spokesman Khalid Mujahid described the incident as a ""terrorist attack.""One report said the target appeared to be supporters of the security forces who were praying at the mosque.Local people are also quoted as saying that followers of Sufism, or Islamic mysticism, regularly gathered at the mosque.Islamist jihadist groups, including so-called Islamic State (IS), see Sufis as heretics.About 50 ambulances were rushed to the attack site to shift the injured to hospitals.No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack and there is no word yet on what happened to the terrorists involved. However, it bears the hallmarks of an attack by ISIS , reports said.There have been regular attacks blamed on terrorists on the Sinai peninsula since the January 2011 revolution that toppled former president Hosni Mubarak, but this is the deadliest assault of its kind.The attacks targeting police and military increased after the ouster of Islamist ex-president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 by military following massive protests against his rule.Over 700 security personnel have been reported killed since then.The military has launched security campaigns in the area, arrested suspects and demolished houses that belonged to terrorists, including those facilitating tunnels leading to the Gaza Strip.The Egypt government has announced three days of mourning, even as President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi chaired an emergency meeting with officials to review security situation after the deadly attack.Egypt has witnessed a series of terror attacks this year claiming scores of lives.On May 26, gunmen attacked a bus carrying Coptic Christians in central Egypt, killing at least 28 people and wounding 25 others.On April 9, two suicide bombings at Palm Sunday services at churches in the northern cities of Alexandria and Tanta left 46 people dead."

In the festive season, the Delhi Police usually has its hands full maintaining law and order across the city. However this year, due to the pandemic , they have to also ensure that shoppers and sellers are wearing masks, markets are not overcrowded and people are maintaining social distancing. The Delhi Police had collaborated with market associations weeks in advance to ensure all protocols are being followed. But as shoppers will admit, in most popular markets like in Janpath Karol Bagh and others, rules are being flouted. We recently visited some markets across the city to take a stock of the situation.If you’ve recently visited any market, it’s likely that you have seen people without their mouths and noses covered and have had to resort to mask shaming them. Considering the increase in shoppers and the number of people violating COVID norms , in the recent weeks, the police has intensified checks across city markets. Delhi Police’s stats reflect that in June-October, around five lakh people have been challaned for not wearing masks.Sanjay Bhatia, DCP, Central Delhi, says, “Keeping in mind that shoppers will visit markets in the festive season, the Delhi Police had formed special teams to keep an eye on those violating rules. Our foot patrolling teams are ensuring that both shoppers and vendors are following the protocols of social distancing. We’ve put up boards to spread awareness about the disease in order to remind shoppers that they are shopping in the pandemic, and hence they should limit their exposure.” Police officials add that they’ll be making announcements in markets also to ask people to follow rules.When we visited markets, we saw that as soon as shopkeepers noticed police personnel approaching, they started requesting shoppers to maintain social distancing. On seeing the police, some shoppers as well as shopkeepers also pulled up their masks, which were otherwise pulled down or dangling from their ears.A policeman tells us, “Some people will argue for 20 minutes when you pull them up for not wearing a mask! We first warn them and if they wear the mask and comply with what we say, we don’t penalise them.”In Janpath, on seeing the team of patrolling cops, a vendor discouraged a shopper from trying out clothes. “If you keep trying every jacket, it won’t be safe for other customers and I will have to stop showing you more items,” we heard him telling the shopper. A staff member of an apparel store in Sarojini Nagar also had a similar complaint. “The police teams visit to explain protocols and tell us to follow rules, but what about the customers? We have had customers who don’t hesitate trying on clothes despite COVID.” We also saw policemen giving tips to shoppers: “If you have to go shopping, don’t plan it during the peak hours.”Chandrakant Dixit, a shopper in CP, said, “People are not just challaned for not wearing masks, they are also challaned for spitting. But visit any market and you will find that even during the pandemic, people flout hygiene norms.”"

"Beating public servant cannot be tolerated, says high court while denying Mumbai man pre-arrest bail",,"Bombay high court. (File photo)

MUMBAI: Bombay high court last week denied pre-arrest bail to a man accused of assaulting a policeman in Goregaon(west), western Mumbai suburb , when asked to down the shutters to their shop during lockdown.

The request to close the shop was made by the police at 10.45 pm on June 29. The court however, granted pre-arrest bail for PR Bond of Rs 25000 to the man’s father Malang Qureshi, 70, “considering the much lesser role attributed and his advanced age”.

Justice Sarang Kotwal on October 21 said “the offence is serious.’’ He said, “A public servant carrying out his duty in the interest of society was assaulted and this fact cannot be tolerated.’’ Thus, he said, at this stage, the accused Khwaja Qureshi “does not deserve any protection considering gravity of the offence.’’ The FIR said he was also not wearing a mask, and refused to wear when asked.

Qureshi’s lawyer Vijendra Kumar with Priti Jaiswal said Khwaja was not even present at the site and denied assaulting the police. He said eyewitness statements were “manipulated’’ and the CCTV footage does not show them assaulting the informant. Advocate Kumar also said that Malang came there subsequently and was trying to disperse the mob and was in fact helping the first informant. He said there was no shop and the allegation was that the grocery articles were sold from residential premises.

But prosecutor Rutuja Ambekar said there was CCTV footage which was shown to nearby residents, one of whom identified both men. She said “such acts have to be discouraged and should not be condoned’’.

After seeing affidavit of the investigating officer, the HC observed there were “independent eye witnesses to the incident and they have identified both the accused as assailants.’’ There is CCTV footage too.

"Allot cremation, burial grounds as per population size: BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj",,"BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj (File photo)

LUCKNOW: A week ahead of polling for byelections in seven assembly seats in UP, BJP MP from Unnao Sakshi Maharaj on Monday kicked up a controversy by saying that large burial grounds for Muslims and limited space for cremation of Hindus is ""discriminatory"".

Speaking at a public meeting in Unnao in support of BJP candidate Srikant Katiyar from Bangermau seat, Sakshi Maharaj said burial and cremation grounds should be allocated as per the population.

""Agar ek bhi musalmaan hai gaon mein to kabristan bahut bada hai…aur aap apne khet ki medh par daah sanskar karte hain, Ghor anyay nahi hai kya? (Even if there is only one Muslim, the burial ground is large. And you (Hindus) cremate your loved ones on the sides of farm fields. Isn’t this injustice,"" he questioned.

""Majboori kuchh nahi hai…bas humare dhairya aur shaleenta ki pariksha na li jaaye (There is no restraint…but one should not test our patience),"" he said.

This is not the first time that Sakshi Maharaj had made a controversial statement. On January 7, 2015, he had urged Hindu women to produce at least four children to protect religion.

After Dadri lynching case , when the then state government had increased ex gratia from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh, he had termed it as appeasement. He had also said that Hindus were ready to kill to stop cow slaughter.

Jaya Bhattacharya and her former classmates adopt a sloth bear at the Lucknow Zoo,,"If there is one thing that has been a constant mood lifter during the pandemic for television actress, Jaya Bhattacharya , it would be looking after animals. Recently, the Lucknow-born actress, Jaya and her school mates adopted a sloth bear (a vulnerable species) at the Wajid Ali Shah Prani Udyaan (Lucknow Zoo) The batch of 88’ donated a sum of Rs 30,000 for the upkeep and maintenance of the sloth bear for a period of six months.Shifali Asthana of the Lucknow Zoo handing the adoption certificate to Ritu Trivedi (BCCL)Speaking about the bear adoption Jaya, who’s seen in the show Silsila Badalte Rishton Ka 2 these days, says, “One of my former classmates, Mona Dutta shared a post for adoption of animals at the Lucknow Zoo in our school Whatsapp group. So I floated the idea of us girls coming together to adopt an animal. I also shared the idea with Amrita Oberoi my former classmate. The idea appealed to everyone and we were like whoever can contribute as much as they can, given the pandemic situations, let's get down to it. We kept a minimum and maximum limit for the contribution as well. The minimum being Rs 1000 and maximum, Rs 2000, so that it didn’t pinch anybody’s pockets. So, a couple of more classmates, settled abroad, also joined in.” Then the question came of which animal to adopt. So the girls sourced the list of animals needing adoption and selected the sloth bear, also an endangered species, to adopt.“Finally last week, Ritu Trivedi, who works for the CBRI, went to the Lucknow Zoo to collect the adoption certificate and hand over the cheque to the zoo authorities, and that’s how we made it work. This is our way of motivating people across to give back to the society,” adds Jaya.The sloth bear named Jaamvant adopted by the class of ‘88 of St Agnes’ (BCCL)The animal lover adds, “I’m sure each child must have visited the zoo at some point of time in life. Each one of us has gone their on school picnics, with family and with friends. So, when anything in Lucknow calls out for help, together we can do loads of things. It is just that somebody has to stand up, gather up and start working. There are more animals at the Lucknow Zoo that need contribution from us.”Contributing to the welfare of animals housed at the zoo, Jasmine Batra (currently residing in Australia) said, “To think about those vulnerable animals, who are held in captivity, not having the basics of enough food, it doesn’t feel okay to let them suffer like that. Anything one can do to ensure they have access to the essentials, is a cause worth taking up and then when you do it with school friends, it provides additional joy. The joy of knowing that the friends with whom you shared your childhood with, they’re now sharing the care of a sloth bear. That thought itself is so adorable.”— Yashi Agarwal"
Exclusive! Titanium to Let's Love: David Guetta on making music that moves generations,,"Read Also

French DJ David Guetta is back with Sia to give fans and music lovers a new song of hope - ' Let's Love '.The new single, which was produced and recorded during the COVID-induced lockdown, marked the hit duo's ninth song collaboration. Looking back at the friendship he forged with Sia over the years, Guetta, in an exclusive interview with ETimes, got candid about making music that defines a generation, hopping on-board the K-Pop wagon, reinventing himself and the changing face of the music industry in the times of a global pandemic.From 'Titanium' that defined an era in music with raucous teens screeching the lyrics ""I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose; fire away, fire away"" to getting them to mellow down and change the discourse with 'Let's Love', Guetta said, ""It’s funny you ask because I have been thinking about this a lot.""Explaining how the language of his music changed over the years, he said, ""In 2009, I produced ‘ I Gotta Feeling ’ with The Black Eyed Peas - the year after the Global Financial Crisis. The record became a global #1 hit and I think it was definitely because people wanted to listen to feel-good music. This year I’ve felt inspired by this again. I want to produce music that makes people feel good.""Sharing the inspiration behind 'Let's Love', David said, ""I really wanted to make a happy track because the world was going through some pretty dark times.""His latest track, featuring Sia is an ode to the '80s synthwave culture. Revealing the reason behind incorporating the funky tunes, he said, ""When I think of happy music I immediately think of the ’80s because the sound back then was very cheerful, very upbeat; which is why we chose to take inspiration from that. Working with Sia on this felt very natural, she’s one of the most talented artists I know and when it comes to making such a power anthem no one can compare to her.""Interestingly enough, the DJ says that all it took was a text with some piano chords and his idea of the track for the songstress to work her magic and send the lyrics back ""within 24 hours!""Diversifying his profile and range as an artist, the DJ recently produced BLACKPINK's hit track ' Lovesick Girls '. Speaking on the possibility of a future collaboration with the leading K-Pop bands, he said, ""I would definitely be open to it. The most important thing for me is that I like the song we made and that I am proud of it. If they reach out to me and I like the sound then why not!""With the pandemic bringing industries around the world to a grinding halt, several artists have shared their concerns over the change in the global music scene. Sharing his take on the current grim situation, Guetta said, ""The pandemic has definitely had a huge impact on the global music scene and my thoughts really go out to all the people that work within the industry. I’m very lucky because I don’t have to think about what I’m going to eat the next day but it’s been very tough on a lot of people in the industry.""Looking at the brighter side of this lockdown, he explains, ""For me, it has actually been a very productive period and I’ve also really enjoyed the downtime. I’m used to constantly touring and travelling all over the world so it felt really good to be able to wake up in the same bed every morning. I’ve also been able to spend a lot of time with my kids. This summer is actually the first summer I got to spend with them. We went on holiday in France and I’m really grateful for the time I got to spend with them.""Using his time to the fullest, Guetta has also been working on some new tunes and constantly trying to reinvent himself and his music. We asked him to share a little about his impressive 'WAP' Bootleg, and he happily obliged. ""I had a lot of fun creating that Bootleg. I’ve actually been very productive during the lockdown, it’s been a great period for me to focus on my creativity so I’ve made a lot of music,"" he said.""My friend MORTEN and I started this new sound called ‘Futur Rave’ and we were hesitant to release it at first because it is a sound that was made for festivals - which we, unfortunately, cannot do right now - but, we released it anyway because we felt the fans deserved it. We’ve had an amazing response to it so there’s definitely more stuff coming,"" he added.YouTube demos and tutorials will have to do for a while before we see the star behind the consoles giving EDM lovers some new tunes to jam to. Still, Guetta promises, ""I really hope I can be back soon to play for all my Indian fans. I want to thank them all fans for the support. They always make my visits very special and I cannot wait to party with them again.""In the spirit of his latest track, he signs off saying, ""Love you guys!"""

I Did it Again ,’ is a quirky track, full of humour, punches, intelligently written lyrics, and peppered with upbeat music.Speaking about the song, Nikhil Taneja , co-founder and CEO Yuvaa, a youth media organisation, says, “The track is a part of UN’s initiative, ‘Share Verified’ which aimed at curbing the menace of fake news. When we were asked if we would help spread the message and be a part of the cause, we were delighted as Yuvaa has also been working in the same direction. However, the idea was to make it fun and interesting and not to be preachy at all. Nobody wants to listen to people giving gyaan. It had to be catchy with witty lyrics and fun visuals. While one will enjoy watching the video and listening to the song, the intention is to remind them one has to be careful about sharing news on WhatsApp, and other platforms.”The virtually shot music video features celebrities like Nakuul Mehta, Akash Banerjee, Maanvi Gagroo, Shreya Dhanwanthary Gurmehar Kaur , Yahya Bootwala, Meghnad, and mothers. Sung by Siddhant Bhosale and Saba Azab, the ‘Hinglish,’ track has received a lot of love on social media for reminding people to stop forwarding fake news in a cool, fun way, while taking them on a trip down memory lane.According to a report on UN’s official website, “Unreliable and false information is spreading around the world to such an extent, that some commentators are now referring to the new avalanche of misinformation that’s accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic as a ‘disinfodemic.”Nikhil quips that people being indefinitely confined to their homes, lack of human interactions and connections, increased screen time, consumption of news, etc have resulted in a decline in attention span, thus tempting people to ‘share what they receive’ almost instantly. He adds, “People have a lot of time in hand and they’re spending much more time with their screens now. Every second, there’s a new notification on their mobiles which gives them a dopamine hit. We, as humans, love to share any piece of news or information that resonates with our biases without thinking, this way, we let the biases get the better of us. Oftentimes, we don’t even open the link or read the news, before forwarding to someone else, let alone verifying or checking its authenticity. We live in times when a piece of misinformation/fake news can lead to disastrous consequences while also impacting our mental health. Many of us feel that if we are the first one to forward a new piece people will think, isko sab kuch pata hai. It is important to dissociate ourselves from the constant flow of information, and take the onus and think responsibly. It is time to fight-back and be self-aware. We have to catch ourselves before we fall into the rabbit hole of negativity.”Actor, director, and musician, Saba Azad , who has belted out the number, says that she jumped at the idea of creating the song and being a part of the video. “The song was done pretty much in two days and it was a lot of fun making it. Initially, the idea was to just have my voice, but I thought Siddhant, who was composing the song, has an amazing voice, too. So, we both ended up singing the track. Besides sending such an important message to the world, Britney Spears’ song was the cherry on the cake,” says Saba.Emphasising on the need to talk about curbing fake news in the present time, Saba, says, “The times that we are living in, where there’s a pandemic, communal tension and constant inflow of negative news on news channels and on our screens, we need to be extremely mindful. I wish there were certain rules to regulate and curb misinformation and rumour on TV, social media, and chat groups. Unfortunately, there is no system to do that which is why the onus is upon us to verify the information and be cautious.”Model-actress Shreya Dhanwanthary, who was seen in ‘Why Cheat India,’ who is also a part of the video, says the song couldn’t have been more relevant than now. She says, “I urge everyone to believe or forward anything blindly. Ek basic google search toh karna hi chahiye. Like many, I, too, received messages like ‘dolphins were spotted at the Juhu Beach during the lockdown,’ which obviously wasn’t true! People are extremely impatient and don’t wait for a second before they share a half-baked piece of information with others. They never check it on reliable portals and authorised organisations because they are in a hurry to share it with others. It is important to be comfortable with not knowing everything, instead of learning something that is false and not authentic. Misinformation or half-truth is dangerous and is like a game of Chinese whisper.” The actress says that she has urged friends and relatives not to believe news that they receive and forward/share links and posts on WhatsApp and social media platforms, without verifying them."

Shaan: Singers are at the beck and call of music companies and they crave creative freedom,,"In the last few months a lot of singers have been connecting directly with their fans, performing for fans online, come up with their own music labels, online channels, and have found a way of publishing their own music independently.Singer Shaan , however, did not wait for the lockdown to do so, and began this process over two years ago. He believes that every singer craves freedom to showcase their creativity, so publishing their own music is the best way to accomplish that.“It is very interesting that singers have come up with their own music labels. As singers we are always at the beck and call of music companies , the music directors and the producers. The singer is the last cog in the wheel when it comes to a song. When a song is created the lyrics are first, then the composition and then of course the music, the production, the situation and then finally it is about kisko gawaye? Accha chalo isko gawate hain. So, it is interesting that you can now create your own music,” he shares.Shaan feels passionately about this and reiterates that singers are also musicians and are creative people.Shaan reiterates that singers are also musicians who are creative people. “So, when we have a song in our minds and kuch alag humein karna hai, toh woh kaise karein? Toh yahi ek upay hai, ki apna hi ek music label ho, apna ek music publishing house bana lo, wahan koi aapko rokega nahin, tokega nahin. You can do whatever you want, the way you want it. That is the freedom every singer craves for after a while,” he adds.“We are always at the end of the line. We get everything ready-made, and we just have to sing and present it in front of people. So, your creativity and contribution are limited to just as a singer. But as a creative person, you might want to explore your voice more, your music better,” he says, adding, “I started my own label because I wanted to explore myself as a composer. Through this, I have released over a dozen songs already. My new song ‘China’ is a Bengali one.”"

"Vani Tripathi Tikoo: I will always remember Ebrahim Alkazi as a great guru, a great artist, a great storyteller, and above all, more than a father to me",,"I shall say goodbye to my guru, one man who actually taught me to live. He was not just a theatre guru , not just a teacher who taught me to act or taught me how to see theatre or how to study it, but he actually gave me insights into what is called looking into the fine moments of life around you. I am from the last batch of students of the legendary Ebrahim Alkazi , but very few people know that I have also spent a decade with him after that. Each play with him was like an investigation into life itself.My first play with him was my first learning into becoming a woman. What do I mean by that? I was a girl who used to wear jeans, short jackets, and leather boots and for the play's costume, I was given a big, fat, fluffy Victorian gown. At first, I could not even carry myself and I would fall everywhere. It was only after a couple of days that I understood why he did that to me. It was because he realised that I was a bit tomboyish and that feminine side of mine, probably that side of being a young girl, got into a bit of obscurity. It had taken a backseat. Next couple of months, almost nine months of rehearsing that play was a peek into life and relationships. But when I look back at my training years with him, every play I did with him was a masterclass of life itself.The Greek tragedy, 'Electra', that I did with him was again a great exercise in human psychology. He would go deep into the history and the background of the time and also into the whole psychology part of it which led to the term - Electra Complex. I was Electra, and that was a deep investigation into the human mind.After finishing work at the Living Theatre Academy in Delhi, the next decade was my personal experience with him through art and painting at Art Heritage , his foundation. Through all the mechanisms of what goes into creating art, he actually taught me how to look at the beauty of life. He used to say that when you start believing in yourself, thinking that you are successful, it is the beginning of the end. He used to always say, ""A teacher will always remain a student. I always learn as much as you learn from me. With each passing generation how the times have changed with the beauty and art around us. How storytelling has changed.""I am inundated with emotions right now, with memories, with the craft that he left with me as a student. Ebrahim Alkazi was also a living legend of our times. The National School of Drama (NSD) would not have happened if he had not been there (Ebrahim Alkazi served as the director of the NSD from 1962 to 1977). The one great gift he left me with, apart from being an actor, was the attention to detail and the interest that I have in theatre academics.Years ago, when I told him about my theatre work in Bhopal, he smiled beautifully, and said to me, ""I am proud of the fact that one of my students at least understood what theatre academics is."" He always believed in creating and nurturing institutions because he always said that the legacy of a teacher is passed from one generation to another, and that’s exactly what he did at the NSD for more than two decades. I cannot thank him enough, and I will always remember him as a great guru, a great artist, a great storyteller, and above all, more than a father to me.A tearful goodbye.

Then the father sends him a video of the TOI press which shows how the paper is sanitised and how the vendors are checked for their heath and given sanitizers to use before every delivery. He explains that it is perfectly safe to get the newspaper. Hearing this, the son restores his father’s subscription of TOI which makes him very happy,” shares Privendra.Telling us why he chose such a subject, director Subhadip says, “Well, this is my real life story.

Akash Jagga recalls his struggling days in Mumbai,,"Akash Jagga's show ‘Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2’ has wrapped up, but the actor is sure that this is just the beginning for him. In fact, the boy from Jaipur, who came to Mumbai with big dreams in his eyes, believes that he has come a long way. Recalling his early days in this city, he says, “I found it difficult in Mumbai without family and friends. However, in a month or two, I got used to it. I started cooking on my own and doing the household chores. The experience made me extremely independent and self-reliant.”While he quickly got used to living alone, making a foray into the industry was not so easy. Akash says, “As an aspiring actor, my first six months in Mumbai were really bad. I was nervous while giving auditions and meeting people. But, still, I continued attending auditions almost on a daily basis. When you are away from your loved ones during a low phase, even hearing their voice can make you emotional. Fortunately, my parents believed in my dreams and supported me through thick and thin. They are my pillars of strength.”Today, Akash says that he has become wiser and stronger, and doesn’t get bogged down by the fiercely competitive nature of the industry. “Whether there is competition or not, the most important thing for an actor is his craft. Forget others, sometimes, we become our own rivals. For example, we might keep thinking about a particular scene and how we could have performed better. While self-analysis is important, it’s important to not pressurise yourself. I now realise that what’s done is done. Moving on is the only option; what matters is giving your 100 % in your next scene,” he explains.The entertainment industry has been facing a lot of allegations these days, including charges of nepotism, casting couch and even drug abuse. Were his parents worried in the wake of the recent controversies? Did they ask him to return home? “They were a bit worried, but my parents and I share a really good bond. There are no secrets between us. So, they know that I am on the right track and there’s nothing to worry about,” he signs off."

However, till now, the current contestants seem to be confused about what they have to do inside the house. They don’t have a point of view and are too reliant on the seniors. While the presence of seniors helps establish an immediate connect with the audience, the drawback is that the freshers aren’t playing their own game. Competition nahi hai.”Shehnaz feels that during the previous season, which also featured her, the contestants had tried their best to make a mark for themselves. “Hamaare season mein pehle week se lekar end tak jo bhi raha hai, sab apna best dekar gaye hain. I don’t see that drive in any of the current contestants. Kuchh karna hi nahi chahte just because seniors hain. In fact, they are being remote controlled by the seniors,” she says.Many viewers have opined that ‘Bigg Boss 14’ is like an extension of the previous edition, as Sidharth continues to be in focus. Point this out and Shehnaz says, “‘Bigg Boss’ must have got these seniors for a reason. Sidharth Shukla is the TRP king. Show thoda chal raha hai usko daalne se. I am certain that a lot of people watch it because of him. Having said that, it’s a double-edged sword. The freshers have not been able to make a place for themselves. They are saying, ‘Seniors jab jaayenge tab hi khelenge’. If I were a part of this season as a fresher, I wouldn’t follow a senior blindly. I have a mind of my own aur main sab danke ki chot par karoongi. My advice to the current contestants is, khud ka vajood rakho, lado, bhido ek dum sher ki tarah. Kisi ke aage peeche poonch ban kar mat raho. Apna game khelo without being selfish. Apna stand toh har koi le leta hai, but doosro ka stand lena seekho.”Since she has been following the show religiously, is there anyone she finds fake? “I am saying, fake dikhao but kuchh toh dikhaao. Kuchh dikh hi nahi raha. I am watching the show because of Sidharth Shukla. I won’t watch it after he exits. Jitni der woh ghar mein hai, dekhungi, baad mein nahi dekhungi,” Shehnaz replies.The Punjabi kudi is all praise for her friend, Sidharth, and his game on the show. “He is playing really well. Achha lag raha hai aur uski comedy achhi lag rahi hai. He is flirting with girls, but in a healthy way. A lot of people are judging his conduct outside the house, but I know him well and can vouch that his intention is pure. He can’t help it if the girls are fawning over him (smiles). At the end of the day, he has to talk to someone inside the house,” she signs off."
This is the best time to take your blood pressure reading,2020-10-21 09:00:00+05:30,"Prepare before time for the reading: You cannot just come from a walk and then take your reading. You have to prepare at least 30 minutes before taking the reading. Do not exercise, smoke, drink caffeine, or eat a big meal 30 minutes before taking a reading. All these things can spike your blood pressure.

Sit down comfortably: Sit down or lie down comfortably when taking the reading. Taking the blood pressure when standing can alter the reading. Also, make sure that your hands are positioned properly when taking the reading.

Check the accuracy of the device: Many digital blood pressure machines show different readings. So, it is important to buy the correct blood pressure reader for yourself. You can ask your doctor to recommend one or take the blood pressure machine to the doctor and compare its accuracy against their model."
Coronavirus: Subtle signs that can tell you have already had COVID-19 before,2020-10-20 14:09:49+05:30,"The only way your body ""protects"" you from COVID is by building up antibodies. Antibodies develop when a body battles the virus, recognizes its proteins and creates infection-fighting antibodies that give you immunity against the illness. The only way, right now, to confirm this would be to get an antibody test, which can detect the level of COVID fighting antibodies in the system.

However, since studies have emerged that antibodies start to wane in patients 2-3 months after illness, it might not give the most accurate results.

My COVID story: I had taken COVID test only as a precautionary measure,,"Having arrived in India to be with her ailing mother, Shruti A did not know she would go through such difficult times. She lost her mother, and also found herself to be COVID positive. Here she shares her battle with COVID-19 and how she managed to keep her spirits high during the tough time. Read onI never thought I would sit down to write this, given the private person that I am. But I will remember 2020, the year of the pandemic and I was one of the 27.9 million cases. I was visiting India due to my mother’s emergency condition and it was also during this time that my mother breathed her last. After my mandatory quarantine (post international travel), I and my family were fortunate to perform her last rites and after a week or two, I started helping my father and brother with regaining momentum with their routine.It was also during this time, the paranoia bit me and although we three were maintaining healthy habits like regularly drinking herbal tea, taking supplements and had no suspicious symptoms, I insisted on scheduling a covid test (rtPCR) as a precautionary measure. It was the morning of September 8, when my morning customary coffee was interrupted by a phone call. The voice on the other side said, ‘You’ve been tested covid positive’… That very news shook me to the core, and I exclaimed, “I am Covid positive???”I remember crying to my partner, brooding over why and how I contracted this despite following all safety measures. As unbelievable and dreadful as it was, it was the truth. I had to only find peace in the fact that my father (65) and brother (24), were negative.I had to immediately isolate myself from my family and since I was asymptomatic, I could choose a private hotel. Cut to 12 pm, I am in my hotel room, anxious as to how my next 10 days would look. In the meantime, I also reached out to my relatives and close friends informing them of the same. I tried to keep my morale high and told myself ‘You’re covid positive, but congratulations, you’re asymptomatic, and there’s only one way out, just get OUT OF IT!!’The same time, some of my family friends recommended being in touch with a doctor to monitor my health remotely, who advised me to maintain a healthy diet, exercise, positive attitude and record my vitals (temperature and oxygen levels) twice a day. From my experience in these 14 days, I can definitely vouch for the following if you find yourself in my shoes.Do not, I repeat, DO NOT PANIC; stay calm and isolate yourselfWash your hands oftenGet in touch with your doctorMonitor your health, take vitals (if you can procure the medical devices), be vigilant and be comfortable with your doctor to inform him/ her of any unusual symptomsMaintain a healthy diet, avoid junk and oily foodMake sure to stay hydrated, drink at least 7-8 glasses of water everydayGargle and inhale steam if you can, while quarantinedIndulge in yoga/ physical activity while in isolationlisten to music, soothe your mind and talk to your family membersLimit screen timeIt can be really tough within the four walls, given that there is always a possibility of developing symptoms. However, yoga and reading helped me achieve a positive frame of mind. This experience has also changed the way I looked at life – I am fortunate enough to be asymptomatic and suffering less than the population with severe symptoms.When you know your body is combatting a deadly virus, you know it is not the easiest fact to live with, however I have come out stronger and learnt the importance of self-care. I have made it my new normal to incorporate yoga in my routine and eating and drinking healthy. Mental strength & positive attitude is all you need. I kept reminding myself that “Every experience in life serves as a challenge, so be thankful it happened, live it and grow through it”.How did I keep my spirits high? Whenever I found myself dreading “Why me?” I’d just smile and tell myself “yeah, I have a story to tell my grandkids that their grandma survived the covid pandemic”."

Navratri is one of the most famous Hindu festivals which is celebrated not only in India but all across the globe. The word Navratri is derived from two Sanskrit words—'nava' meaning nine and 'ratri' meaning night. This festival celebrates the defeat of Mahishasura by Goddess Durga and signifies the victory of good over evil. In many parts of India people fast for seven days and break it on the last day of Navratri, only after performing puja. Garba is performed in large groups, while people rejoice this fun-filled festival with their friends and family.This year the nine-day festival would be observed from Oct 17 to October 25. According to the Hindu Panchang, this year Navratri will begin on the Pratipada date of the Shukla Paksha of Ashwin month, which falls on October 17. The auspicious puja time of the first day of Navratri is from 6:23 am to 10:30 pm. Here is the day wise puja schedule for Navratri 2020-On 17th October 2020- Pratipada GhatasthapanaOn 18th October 2020- Dwitiya Maa Brahmacharini PujaOn 19th October 2020- Maa Chandraghanta PujaOn 20th October 2020- Chaturthi Maa Kushmanda PujaOn the 21st October 2020- Panchami Maa Skandamata PujaOn the 22nd October 2020- Shashthi Maa Katyayani PujaOn the 23rd October 2020- Saptami Maa Kalratri PujaOn the 24th October 2020- Ashtami Maa Mahagauri Durga Maha Navami PujaOn the 25th October 2020- Navami Maa Siddhidatri Navratri Paran Vijay DashamThe legend associated with Navratri is associated with the great battle that took place between the demon named Mahishasura and Goddess Durga. Mahishasura was said to be blessed with immortality by Lord Brahma under one condition that he could be defeated only by a woman.The blessing of immortality got to his head and filled him with evil intentions. Mahishasura then went on to attack Trilok--earth, heaven and hell. Since only a woman could defeat him, even the Gods didn't stand a chance against him. The worried Gods prayed to Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva and sought their help to defeat Mahishasura.Lord Vishu took the decision to create a woman to defeat Mahishasura. He created the powerful Goddess Durga. Then Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma also put together all their powers in the Goddess.Durga fought with Mahishasura relentlessly and the battle went on for 15 long dasys. It was a fight that shook the entire Trilok. During the fight, the clever Mahishasura kept changing his forms to confuse his opponent Goddess Durga. Ultimately, when the demon took the form of a buffalo, Goddess Durga pierced his chest with her 'trishul', which finally killed him.This marked the end of the demon and marked the victory of the good over the evil.On each day of Navaratri different avatars of Goddess Durga are worshipped. On the first day, people worship Goddess Shailputri while Goddess Brahmacharini is worshipped on the second day. On the third day, people pay homage to Goddess Chandraghanta and on the fourth day Goddess Kushmanda is worshipped. The fifth day is marked by worshipping Goddess Skandamata, while on the sixth day Goddess Katyayani is worshipped. On the seventh day, Goddess Kaalratri is worshipped and on the eighth day Goddess Mahagauri is worshipped. On the last and final day of Navratri, people worship Goddess Siddhidatri.Navratri is usually celebrated by fasting, worshiping devi ma, doing garba and wearing clothes of different colours for each day of Navratri.

Coronavirus: The thing we are getting WRONG about herd immunity,2020-10-15 11:03:19+05:30,"Herd immunity comes into play when a considerable number of people have built an immune response towards a disease, leading to fading away of the outbreak. In such a scenario, although not everyone is immune to the said virus/disease, the disease will not be able to lead to major outbreaks.



While it is true that immunity can be achieved through vaccination or through the infection itself, but in case of COVID we can’t be so sure in the absence of a preventive vaccine. This is because there is no surety that everyone who recovers will stay immune to it. There have been cases of reinfection that makes us doubt how long COVID immunity lasts after recovering from the infection."

"Comedy Couple Review: Saqib, Shweta shine bright in this fresh yet predictable rom-com",,"STORY: Deep Sharma (Saqib Saleem) and Zoya Batra (Shweta Basu Prasad) are a hit pair in the stand-up space. Slowly but surely, the duo is making its presence felt in the digital world, too. But all’s not well in their la la land and the couple finds itself stuck in the middle of many a storm — in their professional as well as personal lives. How do they sail through these difficult times?



REVIEW: Touted to be India’s first and only comedy couple, techie-turned-comic Deep Sharma and his romantic partner Zoya Batra always have their audience rolling with laughter, thanks to the silly yet relatable jokes they crack on stage. But, other than recently attaining the title of being a ‘viral act’ on the internet, the duo has also attracted some unwanted hurdles in their seemingly perfect life. Deep and Zoya, both as different as chalk and cheese, are headed towards troubled waters and they know it all too well. One event leads to another and now they have a conundrum to resolve: whether to keep their differences aside and ride on the wave of their joint success or to shun their collaboration and bow down to what life has in store for them.



Director Nachiket Samant’s ‘Comedy Couple’ is a sweet, endearing love story between an ‘eight/nine on 10’ high-society girl and a self-admittedly average former IT professional from a hamlet in Uttar Pradesh. The narrative is nothing unique but the stand-up angle renders freshness to this otherwise common trope and we dig the chemistry the lead pair shares.



In one of the intimate scenes, Zoya breaks it to Deep that he is a five or six at best on his good days, a compulsive liar and that he isn’t innately funny. Deep agrees without putting up a fight and admits to be an acquired taste as a comedian. The tone and overall vibe of ‘Comedy Couple’ is pretty clear from the start — a desi lad scores an urban belle, finds his lane with her and boom… he is happily dancing to her tunes: both on stage and otherwise. This underlying theme has been a recurring subtext in rom-coms for years now but despite the somewhat predictable diegesis, the flick draws you in with those hilarious one-liners and the stand-up mood and setup in general. Also, Shweta Basu Prasad is a natural as the independent, dominating girlfriend with a knack for sexually charged and socially awkward jokes. Keeping up with Deep’s persona, Saqib downplays his performance in the first half but his character undergoes an ocean of change after the interval. And brownie points to him for acing the colloquial Haryanvi accent!



A surprise package in the film was real-life comedian Aadar Malik’s nutcase, stoned-out-of-mind Rohan. As a filthy man and proud jugadoo (please listen to his seven-staircase story intently), Malik is riotous to a T. Other parallel characters add the right amount of humour to the plotline, but it is Aadar who stands out for his zoned-out act. Another actor who makes an impact with her brief performance is Pooja Bedi as the male-bashing artiste and Zoya’s single parent, Zohra Batra. Bedi channels the spirit of a paradoxical person — claims all men are as*holes and then gets bored of her own boyfriend.



As far as the pace and plot progression go, ‘Comedy Couple’ is off to a rocking start but bumps off to rocky roads soon after. The middle is a bit derailed and draggy, often compromising on its strongest suit: humour. Samant and his army of writers — Raghav Raj Kakker, Kashyap Kapoor, Bikas Ranjan Mishra and Gaurav Sharma — inculcate the hit formulae of comedy, i.e; ‘gaalis’ and ‘sax’ and even bring to light the constant conflict between comedians and pressure groups, but fail to up the ante, especially with that foreseeable climax.



In a nutshell, ‘Comedy Couple’ is your typical Bollywood rom-com with a fresh pair and even fresher central theme. Look the other way if you are pining to witness innovation in this genre, stay if you are in it only for the laughs!

Laghushanka Review: An over-simplistic approach towards a complex problem,,"STORY: A young girl, Shruti — who is about to get married — is suffering from an embarrassing disorder, bed-wetting. Given the fact that she is tying the knot in exactly two days, will Shruti come out clean to her future in-laws before marriage?



REVIEW: Since this social drama is only 15 minutes long, director Nikhil Mehrotra jumps right into the issue at hand — the taboo around discussion pertaining to one’s bed-wetting problem in the sleep. In an emotional scene, Shruti is seen confiding in her supportive yet submissive mother (Kanupriya Pandit) and the limbo that the two of them are in pretty much forms the crux of ‘Laghushanka’. The biggest dilemma that this bride-to-be and her family is facing at the moment is whether to reveal this rather embarrassing secret to her future in-laws or hide it till the wedding nuptials are done with. Is the foundation of Shruti’s married life going to be based on a lie that her clan wants her to tell or is she going to rebel and let the cat out of her bag?



After writing multiple critically-acclaimed Bollywood movies script (co-written ‘Panga’, ‘Dangal’ and ‘Çhhichhore’ to be precise), the short film ‘Laghushanka’ marks the directorial debut of Nikhil Mehrotra. Although the theme is sensitive and there is hardly any content around it, Mehrotra manages to keep it simple and engaging at the same time. Like the discussion within the family where people are more concerned about their wedding outfits than the big revelation itself is wacky and an attention-grabbing technique successfully used by the writer-director. In addition to that, the chaos and commotion surrounding the ongoing marriage preparation adds the right amount of humour to this otherwise serious social commentary. To sum it up, Mehrotra’s writing is taut and goes with the flow but its climax turns out to be predictable. The background music by Mannan Shaah merges well both with the dramatic aspect as well as its funny bits. Some stories make for great short films, but, unfortunately, this one needed a longer run-time.



Shweta Tripathi is convincing in her role as Shruti — her facial expressions and body language have a greater impact than the dialogues she mouths. Kanupriya Pandit and Narottam Baid as worried parents are up to the mark. Other family members have their own ways of pushing the plotline forward with Yogendra Vikram Singh leading the pack as the groom-to-be.



All said, ‘Laghushanka’ is one of those tales that are hard-hitting, intriguing but lack the depth they needed and deserve. This satire could have started a serious discussion on a subject that is barely talked about but ends up being a half-baked attempt at handling something this delicate instead.

Bahut Hua Sammaan Review: An interesting cocktail of comedy and reality,,"STORY: Two struggling engineering students, Bony (Raghav Juyal) and Fundoo (Abhishek Chauhan), are tired of being called failures and want to do something big with their lives. Do they have a plan to become success stories or does life have something else in store for them?



REVIEW: ‘Bahut Hua Sammaan’ revolves around the students of Uttar Bharat University of Varanasi, Bony and Fundoo in particular, who have flunked in their final year. They get frustrated with the fact that their juniors are getting jobs through campus placement while they struggle to even graduate. Pretty soon their lives take a drastic turn when they meet maverick Baba Bakchod (Sanjay Mishra), who sets a plan in motion to earn some quick bucks by robbing the university’s bank lockers. Will this robbery helped them redeem themselves and lead successful lives?



In no time, it becomes evident that Baba Bakchod planned this heist to pocket a very precious possession—the Kohinoor. However, it’s not just him who has his eyes set on the Kohinoor but there are other dangerous people involved as well—notorious Guruji aka Anand Bairagi Maharaj (Dibyendu Bhattacharya), corrupt Union Minister Ajay Singh Parmar (Punkaj Kalraa) and his ruthless assassin, who is also an ex-commando, Lovely Singh (Ram Kapoor). That’s not all, small-time thugs Raju (Bhoopesh Kumar Singh) and Bhola (Sharat Sonu) also try to get their hands on the loot. All in all, things get messier when police inspector, Bobby Tiwari (Nidhi Singh), is roped in to solve the impending case and all the commotion surrounding the heist.



Through ‘Bahut Hua Sammaan’, director Ashish R. Shukla sends out a strong message—loud and clear—we should always be inquisitive and keep questioning the functioning of the government and not just be blind follower of anyone in power. Emphasising on the saying, “Revolution is not a two hours film, it’s a constant force necessary for democracy,” this political satire is off to a rocky start but manages to lure us in with the unfolding of an interesting chain of events. But all that changes when too many sub plots are planted at regular intervals, making the screenplay go haphazard beyond a point of return. Overall, it has all the ingredients needed to cook up a funny, socially-relevant entertainer stance a consistently gripping story.



The writers, Avinash Singh and Vijay Narayan Verma, have penned down a story that is relatable, especially given the current political scenario of the country. And special mention goes to the witty dialogues in local UP dialect that enhances the humour factor in the film. The use of 80’s Hindi numbers like ‘Dhanno Ki Aankhon Mein’ adds a sense of nostalgia to the film. Watch out for the climax, which is, surprisingly, the highlight of the movie.



Coming to the performances, Sanjay Mishra is the star of ‘Bahut Hua Sammaan’ as Baba Bakchod: he is funny and entertaining at the same time. Mishra single-handedly shoulders the burden of taking a narrative forward. Raghav Juyal and Abhishek Chauhan have done a commendable job playing two lost young boys from Varanasi. Both the actors pull off convincing performances as Bony and Fundoo respectively. Ram Kapoor looks deadly as the cold-blooded assassin Lovely. As the hard-nosed police officer Bobby Tiwari, Nidhi Singh renders an outstanding performance that proves to be one of the plus points of this social commentary. Her rapport with her over-enthusiastic on-screen husband Namit Das, who wants to start a family, ups the hilarious quotient of the story.



In a nutshell, ‘Bahut Hua Sammaan’ starts off as a goofy comedy but later turns into a conversation about the ongoing socio-economic and political situation of the country that is laced with humour. The film has its heart in the right place, but, sadly execution falters after a point.

Serious Men Review: An interesting observation on the distinction between haves and have-nots,,"STORY: Hailing from a Dalit family, Ayyan Mani (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) wants his only son Adi (Aakshath Das) to have what he didn’t – a life of privilege, opportunities and respect from all strata of society. Upon realising Adi is a child prodigy, Mani starts cashing in on his newfound fame. But is a child this young ready for all that mic-thrusting, caste-based speeches and a scam that his father’s been running? Through this adaptation, director Sudhir Mishra delves into the age-old class distinction prevalent within Indian society. And the themes of haves and have-nots add the quintessential human drama to this relevant piece of cinema.



REVIEW: For as long as he can remember, Korathi-born and Mumbai-bred Ayyan Mani has always been haunted by the story of how his grandfather died in a running train – someone whispered in his ears that he had accidentally boarded the first-class compartment meant only for Brahmins. Sure, Mani is street smart and it is his strong survival instincts that help him climb up the professional ladder: he is the personal assistant to man-of-science Dr. Acharya (Nassar) at the National Institute of Fundamental Research. But being born into a poor farming family in a remote hamlet in Tamil Nadu has its own ramifications – Mani likes his beer ‘not extremely chilled, not warm’ and is obsessed with a life of dough and dignity for his aankhon-ka-tara Adi. Call it sheer luck or a classic case of rags-to-riches at play, Adi turns out to be a genius who has complex chemical formulae at the tip of his tongue. Also, Mani is running a scam on the side while the nation is revelling in the birth of a genius (they call him chota Einstein at one point). If political leaders are willing to pull the family out of its two-by-two kholi among other generosities, then why the con? Based on Manu Joseph’s book by the same name, director Sudhir Mishra’s ‘Serious Men’ is a satire on the stark contrast (or the lack of it) between the rich and educated and the poor and naïve with slight deviation from its original story.



The opening sequence leads us to an unnamed, dingy and poorly-lit chawl in Mumbai with Mani Senior deciphering life with this uninhibited line – “…zindagi bhi aisi hai, complex! Aadmi bematlab hi paida hota hain, marta bhi bematlab hi hai” – and what ensues thereon is absolute madness, coupled with unabashed greed and, of course, nonchalant scheming and scamming. The trope is all too familiar: a man from a marginalised household is hardened by life and all the curveballs he has dodged so far and wants his son to have a better shot at it; we get that. But what sets Sudhir Mishra’s ‘Serious Men’ apart is the way the story is laid out – so out-there and yet so subtle. Other than the atrocities faced by the Dalit community in India, the narrative also brushes its shoulders with the prevalence of ‘pleas’ to embrace Christianity for a better life and the caste card that’s often played within the subjugated communities. It is bold and ironic but no one’s taking any offence because Mishra has inculcated this subtext with the foil of sarcasm wrapped around it. Besides, Nawazuddin Siddiqui has sprinkled Nawazuddin Siddiqui-ness all over the script and the actor sure knows just how to navigate the tricky lanes without rubbing anyone the wrong way. Speaking of which, the lungi-donning actor in this social commentary gets into the skin of Mani as if they are long-lost brothers. While the dialogues maybe easily forgotten, his expressions in the meltdown scenes are a testament to his acting prowess. The child genius Adi aka Aakshath Das is a cocky young man sharing the ultimate secret with his father and, even at such a tender age, he walks shoulder to shoulder with Siddiqui and their twisted accord is palpable. The duo may have lowered the scale of their moral compass but not the God-fearing Indira Tiwari’s Oja; she sort of balances the borderline megalomania out that the other two latch on to. Shweta Basu Prasad’s Anuja is the poster child of oppression (with a crippled leg, burnt marks and a Carnegie Mellon degree) in this dramedy but her role remains under defined and it is criminal not to use a fine actor to her complete potential. The characters essayed by veteran actors Nassar and Sanjay Narvekar (as the local politician and Anuja’s father) do not have much to do in the film other than safeguard their own selfish interests, which they do with aplomb.



Without revealing the twists and turns – all of which are somewhat predictable yet engaging – this movie is packed with surprises and more often than not leaves one scratching their heads (you will know why). Cinematographer Alexander Surkala captures the essence of Mumbai and its dark alleys and juxtaposes the high-rises against the slums at periodic intervals; thank goodness for that! Karel Antonín’s music has this typical deep, artsy ring to it that could never go wrong with a film trying to highlight the biggest ironies of life but towards the end, both the script and its background score tend to derail: dramatic and distracting.



The serious men of our society are the laughing stock in ‘Serious Men’ and though the film reasonably manages to bring to light the conflict between the elite and the easily disposable, it fails to conclude what could have been an excellent social dialogue on a high note. Guess Mishra took too much credence of Siddiqui’s rant on respect, “Public jisko samajhti nahin hain, usko salaam thokti hain; respect karti hain.”

"Over The Moon Review: Tonally unbalanced, but visually stunning",,"Story: A young girl flies to the moon to prove the existence of a goddess.

Review: Fei Fei (Cathy Ang) grows up believing the legendary myth of Chang’e (Phillipa Soo), a goddess who lives on the moon after losing her beloved. Fei Fei is trying to cope with her own loss, following the death of her mother. Years after the heartbreak, her father (John Cho) begins to date Mrs Zhong (Sandra Oh), which does not go down well with the young girl. Additionally, Mrs Zhong’s little boy Chin (Robert G. Chiu) gets on Fei Fei’s nerves. Agitated by the entire situation, she builds a rocket to fly to the moon, where she can meet Chang’e to show everyone back home that she is real. But more importantly, Fei Fei seeks to prove to her father that true love is meant to last forever.

‘Over the Moon’ is directed by Glen Keane, a veteran of animation for four decades. So, it is no surprise the film excels in that department. Combining the latest styles as well as a traditional design approach, the film is visually enchanting with a burst of colours and vivid imagery. Written by the late Audrey Wells, this story on loss and grief is constructed to ensure the heavy themes are still children-friendly. Characters like Fei Fei’s bunny Bungee and the Gobi the lunar pup, endearingly voiced by Ken Jeong, are introduced explicitly for that purpose – to be the cutesy and lovable, if derivative, comic relief. But while there’s no shortage of light-hearted and emotional moments, the plot is admittedly familiar. It’s padded with subplots, and while there are a couple of standout musical tracks, there is at least an equal number that serves little purpose other than exposition.

The animation and songs also work as ample distraction from the systematic workings of the plot, which, unfortunately, drags at various points. Interspersed between a chaotic set of world rules that aren't clearly defined for audiences unaware of Chinese culture and mythology, the life lessons in ‘Over the Moon’ are certainly well-intended. That, along with dazzling visuals and endearing characters, will make it a captivating watch for younger audiences."
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm Review: A scathing satire that gives the middle finger to political correctness,,"STORY: An unusual feminist sequel to 2006 comedy ‘Borat’, this is a scathing satire and brutal social commentary, that gives the middle finger to political correctness, while making a strong case against misogyny and patriarchy.



REVIEW: The story follows Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) a Kazakhstani TV reporter who is sent to America to bribe the powerful men in order to win favours in return. Trouble ensues when his teen daughter (terrific Maria Bakalova) smuggles herself into the United States to be with her father. The film essentially tells a dad daughter story while highlighting the metaphorical cage that women find themselves trapped in even today.



There’s a reason why this film is so important in 2020. We all want to sound woke on Twitter. Outraging and taking offence to insignificant things is now a popular pastime. Our drive to feel superior to others has given birth to an online pandemic called cancelling culture. It has stripped us off our honesty, as we constantly fear being ostracised for speaking our mind. While it’s fashionable to preach courage, deep down we are a bunch of fearful creatures, who seek validation from random people. Enters the audacious maskini clad Sacha Baron Cohen who questions the status quo in his own shocking ways. His explicit ways to get a point across can be cringe inducing and thus not for everyone. However, if you can overlook the pubes, underarm hair, penis jokes, you are guaranteed to have a good laugh.



Unapologetically feisty, the man has a funny bone but most importantly, a spine. His mockumentaries speak truth to power and make you wonder how we as society are yet to change our mindset. We’ve normalised sexual harassment, hatred against Jews, racism, taboos around menstrual blood, unrealistic standards of female beauty and the denial of female masturbation. The film holds a mirror to not only America but the world in general. We aren’t rattled by human rights abusers.



Ahead of the US elections, the comedian wants Americans to be offended for not thinking straight. The jabs on the right wing supporters and Republicans, especially President Trump, VP Mike ‘fly’ Pence and an expose of sorts on Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani are the film’s jaw dropping moments. The Giuliani scene is a shocking real footage that’s used in the film. It shows the senior attorney reaching into his trousers while reclining on a bed in the presence of the actor playing Borat’s daughter, who is posing as a TV journalist for a fake interview. They are then interrupted by Borat who runs in and says: “She’s 15. She’s too old for you.”



Maria Bakalova is as uninhibited and terrific as Sacha. As the dad-daughter emotional angle takes centre stage, the film loses steam and gets generic. However, it provides you with enough and more awkward laughs that also make you introspect. Ridiculous and harebrained yet insightful and hilarious... this isn’t a perfect film that makes for a pleasant watch but it’s audaciously different and daring.

Nocturne Review: It’s sibling rivalry gone so awry that there’s no coming back from it,,"Teenagers Juliet and Vivian are both enrolled in an elite boarding arts academy, are gifted pianists, but somehow Juliet is always seen as playing the second fiddle to her charismatic, vivacious, outgoing and sexuality-oozing twin sister Vivian, who is older than Juliet by just a few seconds. Vivian is the prodigy, whereas Juliet is the underachiever who is never taken seriously by her peers or teachers. Even before her graduation, Vivian has already been accepted into Juilliard, while Juliet has opted to take a gap year, though not exactly by choice. A determined Juliet is ready to go to any extent to fulfill her musical and other desires. Her need to do so gets stronger every day after she accidentally gets hold of Moira’s mysterious theory book that is scribbled with satanic figures and hidden messages, which help her to foresee her future. From getting her own music teacher suspended to seducing Max (Vivian’s steady boyfriend) and even taking her sister’s place at the school’s annual music function, Juliet’s greed, desire and needs seem limitless. The music used in the movie is one of the best features of the movie. Being a musical, classical and various genres of music have been blended here to prepare you for the next twist.



Moving to the good and not so good parts, the movie gives you a feel of ‘Black Swan,’ ‘Inception,’ ‘The Perfection,’ ‘Whiplash,’ but somehow it gets predictable. The horror, jump scare or surprise elements are very limited. The writers could have delved more into the sibling rivalry angle, the mysterious death of Moira and her family, the drawings on the wall which she drew before jumping off the building and the satanic cult, if any, to keep the viewers hooked. The ending leaves you with many unanswered questions, and even a bit deranged. However, the scenes between Juliet and her music teachers-the gentle and milquetoast Roger (John Rothman), whose career she tries to ruin, or the slick and demanding Henry (Ivan Shaw), who explains to Juliet that “music is a bloodsport” so as to inspire her, or Juliet walking towards her sister with bloody tampons, were some of the most amazing moments. The uneasiness between Iseman and Sweeney’s characters makes us curious to know more about the rivalry and jealousy aspects.



Like most Blumhouse productions, this one limits itself to a handful of décors and characters. ‘Nocturne’ is one of the eight horror movies – a joint venture of Blumhouse Television and Amazon Studios, all slated to release on Amazon Prime. Written and directed by Zu Quirke, this film marks her debut. Well, if you like movies which leave you with many unanswered questions, then this one is for you.



"
Evil Eye Review: A romantic horror with a desi twist,,"From executive producers Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Jason Blum, Evil Eye is part of Welcome to the Blumhouse series, a line-up of eight original films from the Amazon Studios that will premiere directly on its streaming service in October.



Based on an audio play by Madhuri Shekar, who adapted it for film and directed by Indian-American twin brothers Elan and Rajeev Dassani, Evil Eye is a suspense thriller that has veteran Sarita Choudhury playing Usha, a superstitious mother whose concern for her daughter spirals into a fierce nightmare as past penetrates the present.



Usha, like a typical Indian mother, is obsessed with getting her daughter Pallavi (Sunita Mani) married. Trying to succeed at matchmaking from miles away, Usha keeps setting up dates for her 29- year-old-daughter who is born and raised in the US. While waiting at a coffee shop for one of these potential husbands to turn up, Pallavi meets Sandeep (Omar Maskati) who is rich, handsome and also Indian. Pallavi and Sandeep hit it off instantly. Pallavi excitedly tells her mom about her new-found love and how she connected with him immediately. But instead of being happy for her daughter, Usha starts to behave in a very strange manner and is convinced that Sandeep isn’t really who he seems to be. Usha strongly feels that Sandeep is the reincarnation of her own abusive and dangerous boyfriend who tried to kill her many years ago, before she escaped and flew to the United States. The screenplay alternates between New Delhi where Usha and her husband have settled after many years in the US, and New Orleans, where Pallavi lives.



The story of the film mainly revolves around the concepts of reincarnation and karma. In the past, we have seen several Hindi films based on similar themes. Some of the striking examples are Subhash Ghai's Karz, Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om. Choudhury is wonderful in her role as a creepy yet caring and oddly comforting mother. The little nuances of the mother-daughter relationship are the highlight of the film. Bernard White, who plays Krishnan, Usha’s supportive husband is also pretty convincing and real. In fact, Usha and Krishnan's relationship have a healthy dose of both humour and stress as he initially dismisses her doubtful behaviour as paranoia but later starts to feel that she's losing her mental stability and needs a medical expert. Editor Kristina Hamilton-Grobler has done a decent job with the constant back and forth between two continents and from present to past, while bringing to attention disturbing incidences of Usha's younger years.



While the thriller, with its good mix of romance, cultural portrayal and supernatural elements, remains engrossing, it fails to be scary along the way. The flashback scenes aren't always effective, making it hard for the viewer to take the scenes very seriously. Also, the plot makes one expect a lot from Maskati whose performance is largely bland. Moreover, the characters Pallavi and Sandeep lack layers and seem very generic.



To sum it up, Evil Eye is a little dose of supernatural with a dash of desi twist. Watch it if you have an inclination for romantic thrillers."

Now in her freshman year, Kelly’s early experience has led to school bullies calling her ‘Monster Girl’. But a spirited Kelly, who is quite the math whiz-kid, doesn’t get bogged down by the bullying. It’s Halloween and she’s excited to go to the party, so she could have a chance with the one guy she’s crushing on. However, her mother Alexa (Crystal Balint) forces Kelly to babysit her boss Ms Zellman’s (Tamsen McDonough) 5-year-old son Jacob (Ian Ho). Once there, Ms Zellman hands Kelly a long list of dos and don'ts for her kid, who just doesn’t go to sleep that easily. Turns out, little Jacob is special and the evil monster Grand Guignol wants to steal his bad dreams to create a nightmare army and take over the world. Also, he’s not alone. He has these tiny weird looking creatures ‘Toadies’ working for him, who kidnap Jacob. But just as Kelly is trying to reach the police, Liz (Oona Laurence) from a global secret babysitter society comes to her rescue. Thus begins the bizarre adventure of busting the monster hideout and rescuing Jacob.



Based on Joe Ballarini’s three-part book trilogy of the same name, this one’s far less haunting than the title suggests. Sure, the plot is novel for the genre but also predictable. It’s all fun and light even when Tom Felton is trying his best to scare us and the kids with all his teeth-clinching and evil laughter. He manages to scare no one. His sidekicks ‘Toadies’ fare much better. They are cute, in a weird way and it’s a treat to watch their goofy antics. We wish they had more screen time because there is just so much potential to have a lot more fun with them.



Director Rachel Talalay vividly brings to life the unreal world of monsters and teenage heroes with a pop of colour and grand imaginative set pieces. Too much CGI is a dampener in some of the scenes. The Halloween night only serves as a backdrop but the narrative moves away from that with Kelly and Liz fighting subtly spooky creatures like the ‘shadow monster.’



A promising Tamara Smart is clearly the life of the film as the wide-eyed teenager on an unexpected adventure. She is believable and quite in control of the goings-on with good support from Oona Laurence as the feisty bike riding babysitter Liz. Rest of the teenage actors are just about average, but performances of the adult cast are a hamfest. Together, they’re all in service of a strictly workable script that doesn’t even attempt to go beyond the basic fleshing out of its key characters.



‘A Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting’ doesn’t quite live up to its monstrous expectations but manages to deliver a mildly entertaining fare with a few laughs. Watch it for the child in you.

"Happy Dusshera 2020 Quotes, Wishes, Messages & Status: Quotes about good winning over evil from literature",,"Dusshera is a festival celebrated by most Hindus and those that believe in the tale of Lord Ram. The festival is celebrated every year on the tenth day in the Hindu lunar calendar month of Ashvin or Kartik, which is the sixth and seventh month of the year. This means it has a different date on the Gregorian calendar every year. This year it falls on Sunday, the 25th of October.It is to celebrate the day Rama, the Avatar of the god Vishnu on Earth, destroyed the demon king named Ravana. It is said that when evil abounds on Earth, God himself takes on a mortal form to destroy it and Rama was the form Lord Vishnu took to help restore balance to the world. The whole story of Rama is a tale of good vanquishing evil, a theme found across many tales in literature from antiquity to today. Here are some quotes from the literary world that speak of good conquering evil:“I hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any evil or misfortune in the world.”― Charles Dickens“A Native American elder once described his own inner struggles in this manner: Inside of me there are two dogs. One of the dogs is mean and evil. The other dog is good. The mean dog fights the good dog all the time. When asked which dog wins, he reflected for a moment and replied, The one I feed the most.”― George Bernard Shaw“People couldn't become truly holy, he said, unless they also had the opportunity to be definitively wicked.”― Terry Pratchett“There is no denying that there is evil in this world but the light will always conquer the darkness.”― Idowu Koyenikan“In each of us, two natures are at war – the good and the evil. All our lives the fight goes on between them, and one of them must conquer. But in our own hands lies the power to choose – what we want most to be we are.”― Robert Louis Stevenson“The best men are not consistent in good—why should the worst men be consistent in evil?”― Wilkie Collins“To see evil and call it good, mocks God. Worse, it makes goodness meaningless. A word without meaning is an abomination, for when the word passes beyond understanding the very thing the word stands for passes out of the world and cannot be recalled.”― Stephen R. Lawhead“I have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather frightened. I am so afraid he will look just like everyone else.”― Oscar Wilde“No matter how hard Evil tries, it can never quite match up to the power of Good, because Evil is ultimately self-destructive. Evil may set out to corrupt others, but in the process corrupts itself.”― John Connolly“Evil cannot and will not be vanquished by evil. Dark will only swallow dark and deepen. The good and the light are the keenest weapons.”― Nora Roberts“Remember, darkness does not always equate to evil, just as light does not always bring good.”― P.C. Cast“Being against evil doesn't make you good. Tonight I was against it and then I was evil myself. I could feel it coming just like a tide... I just want to destroy them. But when you start taking pleasure in it you are awfully close to the thing you're fighting.”― Ernest Hemingway“Evil forges a tornado.But goodness battles in a straight line.”― Caris Roane“You think that your laws correct evil - they only increase it. There is but one way to end evil - by rendering good for evil to all men without distinction.”― Leo Tolstoy“You see, evil always contains the seeds of its own destruction. It is ultimately negative, and therefore encompasses its downfall even at its moments of apparent triumph.""― Neil Gaiman"

On this day, Goddess Durga put an end to a demon named mahishasura's tyranny by killing him with her trident in a battle that lasted for nine whole days. Lanka's demon-king Ravan also met the same fate at the hands of Shri Ram. This is why, the Mother Goddess and Maryada Purushottam established Dharma and restored peace by ending chaos and destruction.Most devotees keep a fast during Navratri, which leads up to Dussehra. It's during this time that the Ram Lila play is enacted where different phases of Lord Rama’s life are portrayed. Shri Ram's victory over Ravan is annually recreated on the 10th day in many parts of the country. This tradition is referred to as Ravana Dahan. Devotees usually flock to see burning giant effigies of Ravan, his son Meghnad and brother Kumbhkarna. An artist dressed as Lord Ram holds a bow and fires arrows at the effigies in order to run them into ashes. This ritual symbolizes the destruction of evil.Devotees of Maa Durga who indulge in Durga Puja celebration during this period, carry the idols of Goddess Durga in huge processions to local rivers in order to immerse them in the river. During the procession, devotees chant slogans as well as seek Maa Durga's blessings. They bid an emotional farewell to the Goddess hoping to have her sooner next year. This custom is symbolic of the departure of Goddess Durga to her husband Shiva in the Himalayas. This marks the end of the Dussehra and Durga Puja."

Ril Future deal: Amazon gets stay on RIL-Future deal,,"BENGALURU: Kishore Biyani ’s deal to sell off Future Group assets to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries for Rs 24,713 crore is now on hold. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) has granted an interim relief in the issue to the Jeff Bezosled Amazon , for now, two people aware of the matter said.Earlier this month, Amazon had approached SIAC over its dispute with Future Coupons, one of the holding companies of Biyani’s Future Group, where Amazon had invested Rs 1,431 crore, citing breach of terms due to its sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries. This was preceded with a legal notice from Amazon to Future Group .While an interim order puts the merger on hold, the matter will continue to be heard at SIAC before the sole arbitrator, former attorney general of Singapore, comes to a decision. Legal experts said, typically, it’s the party dissatisfied with the international arbitration order that takes the matter to Indian courts, but Amazon might have to approach the Indian courts too, depending on the final order.“This was an emergency arbitration hearing, where they (Amazon) sought an interim stay on the merger so that the Future-Reliance deal doesn’t close formally, while the matter is in international arbitration,” a person aware of the development said.The development comes even as Reliance Industries has applied for a clearance with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on its deal with Future Group. Sources aware of the matter said the arbitration proceedings could go on for several weeks before a final order comes. This could also have an impact on banks that have lent to Biyani’s Future Group as the lenders are reportedly worried over their loans turning into non-performing assets (NPAs) owing to arbitration proceedings delaying the merger.“We welcome the award of the emergency arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought. We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process,” a spokesperson of Amazon said on Sunday.A Future Group spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.A spokesperson of Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL) said it is informed of the interim order and that it intends to enforce the rights and complete the transaction with Future Group without any delay. “RRVL has entered into the transaction for acquisition of assets and business of Future Retail under proper legal advice and the rights and obligations are fully enforceable under Indian law. RRVL intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future Group without any delay,” the spokesperson added.Gopal Subramanium, former Solicitor General of India , is one of the legal counsels for Amazon. Harish Salve is representing Future Group in the matter. Meanwhile, Future Group is also considering all available legal remedies on this matter for its next course of action, one of the people mentioned earlier said. However, no decision has been made yet."
Kotak bank Q2 results 2020: Kotak Mahindra Bank Q2 results to be out today,,"Kotak Mahindra Bank

NEW DELHI: Kotak Mahindra Bank is all set to announce the earnings report for the second quarter today i.e. Monday, October 26, 2020, on the official portal of the Bank - kotak.com. The Kotak Mahindra Bank is likely to report around 20 per cent year-on-year decline in its second quarter results for the FY21 profit due to a potential spike in provisions to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Some of the key things to watch out today would be management commentary on growth and overall stress, additional provisions towards Covid-19 pandemic/increase in PCR and performance of subsidiaries.

It has been reported that Kotak Mahindra Bank is exploring a takeover of smaller Indian rival IndusInd Bank, however, the spokesman of the company declined to comment. Kotak Mahindra's 2.7 trillion rupee market capitalization makes it India's third-largest lender by value.

"kotak IndusInd bank news: Kotak may buy IndusInd Bank, says a report",,"MUMBAI: Kotak Mahindra Bank is exploring an acquisition of private sector rival IndusInd Bank , according to a report. The Hindujas’ IndusInd International Holdings (IIHL), which is the promoter of IndusInd Bank, has denied the report, while Kotak has been non-committal.In a late evening report on Sunday, Bloomberg said that Kotak is looking at an all-stock acquisition. It also said that the UK-based Hinduja family began the discussion for selling control of the Mumbai-based lender following a dispute between the four brothers over the family’s fortune.IndusInd promoters currently hold less than 15% in IndusInd Bank through IndusInd InternationalHoldings (see graphic).Ofthe remaining 85%, the bulk is held by institutional investors who have seen the bank’s share price fall by more than 60% to Rs 607. At current prices, the bank has a market cap of less than Rs 46,000 crore.As against this Kotak Bank is only 20% down from its 52-week high even after a dilution and has a market cap of over Rs 2.7 lakh crore. A merger at current prices would bring the Hinduja promoter holding to just above 2%.A deal between Kotak and IndusInd would find favour with the banking regulator as Kotak Bank has a strong capital base and a good asset quality, which gives it a high capacity to absorb a smaller bank. Promoter Uday Kotak ’s stake in his bank has fallen to about 26% after a qualified institutional placement of shares worth Rs 7,442 crore amid the lockdown.“We have no comments to offer,” Kotak Mahindra Group chief communication officer Rohit Rao said. IIHL, a Mauritius-based company, denied the reports by Bloomberg, stating that it is “malicious, untrue and baseless”. The statement said that the Hindujas have reiterated full support to IndusInd Bank — now and always."

Government keen to bring BIs under commerce ministry in next two weeks,,"Union minister Piyush Goyal (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The government has revived the proposal to bring the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) under the commerce ministry from the consumer affairs department . Former minister late Ram Vilas Paswan had opposed the proposal by the commerce ministry highlighting that the BIS has regulatory powers and takes care of consumers interest after the Parliament passed the BIS Amendment Act in 2016 with powers to protect consumers.

Sources said a two-week deadline has been set to complete the task of bringing the agency under commerce ministry. A couple of meetings have been held since Union minister railways and commerce minister Piyush Goyal got additional charge of the food and consumer affairs ministry after Paswan passed away.

The earlier avataar of BIS, Indian Standards institute (ISI) was set up in September 1946 as per a resolution of the department of industrial and supplies. The BIS came into existence as an Act of Parliament in 1986 and it was put under the consumer affairs department.

The opinions are divided over the need to shift the standards making body to the commerce ministry. Some of the former BIS officials told TOI that the proposal was long overdue as the agency is primarily responsible for making standards for industrial goods.

""Across the globe agencies making standards for industrial goods are under the trade and commerce departments. Only in recent years we started setting standards for services. Bringing BIS under commerce will help us go a long way to make India Atma Nirbhar, which is the government's focus,"" said one of these former senior BIS officials.

Another official said this should not be seen as a turf issue.

However, others have a different take on this considering that the BIS not just sets standards but also enforces them and takes action against violations to protect the consumers interest.

A former consumer affairs ministry official said, ""What we need to remember is that both the amendments in BIS Act and the Consumer Protection Act were in sync with each other and primarily aimed at protecting consumers. The current mechanism is enough to set high standards and make them mandatory under the Quality Control Order (QCO) regime that will help protect our domestic industries. But the government can take any decision on such matters,"" he said.

The former bureaucrat also said taking BIS back to the commerce ministry may require the need to set up a new regulator to protect consumers interests. ""Unfortunately, the consumer affairs ministry in our system has little authority unlike other countries despite our claims that the consumer is the king. In India, there are sector specific regulators. Only a new beginning has been made by setting up the Central Consumer Protection Authority with very limited power,"" the official said.

Settlement amount in all cases should be based on the resultant net profit or loss from transactions during the year/ period.""The amount should not be left to the discretion of the Adjudicating Authority or any other authority,"" DTPA Representation Committee chairperson Narayan Jain said."
"Economic, oil demand recovery around the corner with development of Covid-19 vaccine: Opec secretary general",,"NEW DELHI: The secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( Opec ), Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, on Monday exuded confidence that there is an economic as well as oil and gas demand recovery around the corner amid the development of vaccine for COVID-19.However, he noted that currently, the demand recovery is not robust at the moment due to the impact of the virus across the globe.Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, Barkindo said, ""We remain cautiously optimistic that recovery will continue. It may take longer, may be at lower levels. But, we are determined to stay the course.""About the oil and gas sector , he said hydrocarbons would dominate the energy basket as projected in the OPEC outlook for 2020 with a horizon of 2045.He said, ""In our outlook for 2020, the fundamentals look upwards and positive. The demand will continue to grow not only for energy well right up to 2045, we postulate that oil and gas will continue to dominate the energy basket.""According to the outlook, the oil will be in the region of 28 per cent (in energy basket) up to 2045.He added, ""We don't see peaking of (oil) demand. But, we see deceleration of growth rate of demand.""His views assume significance in view of the crude oil price crash in April this year amid the COVID-19 outbreak.He said, ""Both economic growth as well as demand recovery remained anemic at the moment due to largely this virus. Now, we remain hopeful that the governments around the world have learnt the lesson from what transpired in the second quarter of this year (April-June 2020).""The OPEC secretary general noted that the development of vaccines is continuing around the world with some candidates having good prospects of coming to the market as soon as possible.""Therefore, we don't expect a relapse to massive contraction that we saw in the second quarter (April-June 2020),"" he added.On the climate change issue, he said it could be done by using technology, appropriate polices, decisions of government and corporate organisation."
Prime Minister Modi brainstorms with global CEOs on energy paradigm,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday brainstormed with global energy sector leaders on the post-pandemic world order and discussed strategies for accelerating investments in the oil and gas value chain.

The fourth annual meeting deliberated on demand scenario as well as ways to revive investment, particularly in oil and gas exploration and production, official sources said.

The meeting stretched beyond the allotted two hours as Modi engaged with the industry leaders to discuss reforms and future blueprint.

The meeting, held over a virtual platform, was attended by nearly two dozen top CEOs, including UK's BP Plc head Bernard Looney, French energy giant Total's Chairman Patrick Pouyanne and Russian oil major Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber and Qatar Petroleum President Saad Sherida al-Kaabi also attended the meeting. The Indian side included Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani and Vedanta Resources head Anil Agarwal.

Oil cartel OPEC secretary-general Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol and International Energy Forum secretary-general Joseph Mc Monigle also attended the meet.

US LNG firm Tellurian CEO Charif Souki and Lyondell Basell Industries chief executive Bhavesh V Patel too participated in the meeting that also saw attendance from leading service providers such as Schlumberger and Baker Hughes.

India, the third-largest oil consumer and fourth-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, is keen to accelerate investment across the oil and gas value chain, beginning with exploration and production to midstream pipelines and refineries and downstream retailing and last-mile connectivity to consumers.

Modi's first such meeting was on January 5, 2016, where suggestions for reforming natural gas prices were made. More than a year later, the government allowed higher natural gas prices for the yet-to-be-produced output in difficult areas like the deep sea.

Sources said this year's focus was on raising investments in domestic oil and gas exploration and production.

The government is looking at private investment to raise domestic oil and gas production, which has stagnated for the last few years while fuel demand has been rising by 5-6 per cent annually. India is dependent on imports to meet 85 per cent of its demand and more than half of its natural gas requirements.

The Prime Minister in 2015 had set a target of reducing India's oil dependence by 10 per cent to 67 per cent (based on import dependence of 77 per cent in 2014-15) by 2022. Import dependence has only increased since then and the government is now looking for ways to raise domestic output.

Oil secretary Tarun Kapoor made a presentation on an overview of the oil and gas sector at the meeting organised by Niti Aayog and the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.

Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar and oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan also spoke at the event.

"Wall Street tumbles as virus cases soar, stimulus hopes fade",,"(Representative image: AP)

NEW DELHI: US stocks decline picked pace on Monday afternoon, setting the Dow for its worst day in more than seven weeks, as soaring coronavirus cases and a political deadlock over the fiscal relief bill raised doubts about the fate of the economy recovery.

New infections have touched record levels in the United States, with El Paso in Texas asking citizens to stay at home for the next two weeks. In Europe, Italy and Spain imposed new restrictions.

Travel-related stocks, vulnerable to COVID-19 related curbs, dropped. The S&P 1500 airlines index fell 5% and cruise line operators Carnival Corp and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd shed more than 9.5% each.

""People are nervous about the expansion in cases,"" said Christopher C Grisanti, chief equity strategist, MAI Capital Management, Cleveland, Ohio.

""The administration has said it does not want to slow down the economy yet as cases rise they may not have a choice.""

Energy index tracked a more than 3% fall in oil prices. Other economically-sensitive industrials and financials sectors posted the steepest percentage declines among S&P sectors.

Meanwhile, chances of a fiscal stimulus before the presidential election faded as US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said there were a number of areas in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's plan that President Donald Trump cannot accept.

Wall Street's fear gauge hit a near seven-week high even as 60 million Americans voted in a record breaking early turnout as Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden enter their final week of campaigning.

It is also one of the busiest weeks of the third-quarter earnings season that will see results from mega-cap US tech firms including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc.

The tech sector, which includes Apple, is among the only three sectors apart from healthcare and consumer staples that is expected to post an increase in profit compared to a year earlier.

Of the 139 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, 83.5% of them have beaten Wall Street expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

At 12:30 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 767.14 points or 2.68% to 27,577.43, the S&P 500 lost 73.59 points or 2.11% to 3,392.13 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 201.99 points, or 1.75% to 11,347.51.

Software company Oracle Corp fell about 4% after German rival SAP abandoned medium-term profitability targets and warned of a longer than expected recovery time from the pandemic hit.

Hasbro Inc tumbled 10% as quarterly adjusted revenue fell due to coronavirus-led delays in the production of movies and TV shows.

Companies deemed stay-at-home winners including Amazon.com Inc, Zoom Video Communications Inc and video game companies Activision Blizzard Inc and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc rose between 2.2% and 0.3%.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 7.91-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 5.00-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded three new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 38 new lows.

"In fight with Amazon, Future Retail sees liquidation if Reliance deal fails",,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Future Retail Ltd (FRL) will go into liquidation if its deal to sell assets to Reliance Industries fails, the group told a Singapore arbitrator while arguing against Amazon.com Inc's bid to scupper the deal, a legal order seen by Reuters showed.

Amazon on Sunday won an injunction from a Singapore arbitrator to halt FRL's deal to sell assets to Reliance. Amazon alleged FRL had breached certain contract provisions it entered into last year in a separate deal with the US firm.

The dispute centres around FRL's decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.

Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn't sell its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list including any firms from Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani's group. The deal specified any disputes would be arbitrated under Singapore International Arbitration Centre rules.

Shares in Reliance and FRL fell on Monday. Both companies reacted to the arbitrator's decision by saying they want to complete the deal ""without any delay"", setting the stage for a showdown between Reliance and Amazon - each led by one of the world's richest men.

A 130-page order by the arbitrator reveals how Jeff Bezos-led Amazon argued that Future breached agreements which barred it from selling retail assets to entities including Reliance, whose boss Ambani is Asia's richest man. It also shows the level of concern at Future if the deal breaks.

Future's retail unit - which has more than 1,500 outlets - will need to pack up if the transaction with Reliance doesn't go through, hitting the livelihoods of thousands of employees and workers at its vendor firms, the group argued before the arbitrator, according to the order which is not public.

Legal obligations

""If the disputed transaction falls through, FRL will go into liquidation. That will mean that the livelihoods of more than 29,000 employees of FRL will be lost,"" the company's representatives told the arbitrator VK Rajah, a former attorney general of Singapore.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit many businesses, especially in the retail sector, and the FRL-Reliance deal was aimed at protecting the interests of all stakeholders through a large infusion of funds and the acquisition of liabilities, Future argued at the tribunal.

But Rajah ruled that ""economic hardship alone is not a legal ground for disregarding legal obligations"".

Amazon, FRL and Reliance didn't respond to a request for comment.

Amazon welcomed the arbitrator's decision in a previous statement. FRL has said it would take appropriate steps to ensure its deal proceeds unhindered, while Reliance said it will complete the transaction.

Amazon, which counts India as a key growth market where it has invested $6.5 billion, has already been bogged down by antitrust probes and strict foreign investment rules.

The latest tussle puts Amazon at odds not just with FRL but also Ambani and his Reliance group which is fast expanding its e-commerce business, and threatening the dominance of Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart in that space.

Two sources familiar with the matter said the injunction was not automatically enforceable in India and that the order would have to be ratified by an Indian court.

Any subsequent legal order in India to halt the deal would allow Amazon to negotiate with Reliance, Future and banks on the other side, said Murali Neelakantan, a corporate lawyer at Indian law firm Amicus which is not involved in the case.

""If Amazon doesn't get an injunction against the deal proceeding in India, they will probably just get damages even if they win the final arbitration,"" Neelakantan said.

"Aditya Puri hands over charge, Jagdishan takes over as HDFC Bank MD &amp; CEO",,"Aditya Puri (File photo)

MUMBAI: At 5:30 pm on Monday, Aditya Puri stepped out of HDFC Bank 's corporate headquarters after handing over charge to Sashidhar Jagdishan as the new chief executive and managing director of the largest private sector lender .

Over 25 years ago, at a nondescript office across the road in Lower Parel's Kamala Mills compound, Puri had started work as the bank's first head, and built the lender which now employs close to 1.20 lakh people.

Jagdishan had also come to office for the hand-over ceremony. Both Jagdishan and Puri addressed their colleagues virtually during the day, officials said.

In his speech, Puri reminisced about the journey of building the bank which focused on the centrality of the employees, while Jagdishan affirmed to carry his legacy forward and thanked his boss, they said.

Farewell celebrations have been on for the last 25 days at the bank, which reached a crescendo on Saturday with a specially-produced 90-minute virtual event.

The event, which was watched by over a lakh employees, had Puri, senior leadership, current employees and former officials of the bank speaking, they said.

There was entertainment as well, with Shankar Mahadevan singing Puri's favourite old Bollywood numbers, recital of a poem penned in Puri's honour and also an anthem dedicated to him being sung, they said.

Bank House, the corporate headquarters, was lit up over the weekend, with one facade sporting a huge picture of Puri with a message thanking him for his service.

Earlier in the day, in an unusual move, rival ICICI Bank publicly thanked Puri for being an inspiration and for his contributions to Indian banking.

Late in the evening on Monday, the bank informed the exchanges about the completion of Puri's tenure and handover of reins to Jagdishan, as per the mandatory disclosure requirements.

A rare aspect for any business leader which had become a daily practice was not missed even on Puri's last day at work -- leaving office at 5.30 pm.

4 Things your personal care products are hiding from you,,"If you think food laws in India should be stricter, you’ll be appalled to know how regulations pass cosmetics off. With little supervision, most brands exploit the carte blanche they enjoy and lace your favourite personal care products with toxicants. While that shampoo might make your hair smooth temporarily, you might completely lose it in the long run; the body wash that smells of irresistible strawberries might be making your skin itchy; the face wash that promises to be mild may slowly be ageing you.Because the beauty industry is highly unregulated and authorities only supervise products for colour additives and ingredients classified as over-the-counter drugs, the onus of making sure we use everything safe comes down to us. After all, it is our skin and wellbeing is at the risk of getting marred by synthetic chemicals that are not only skin irritants, skin penetrators, endocrine disruptors but also carcinogenic.Which is why, it becomes imperative that you read the labels of all personal care products judiciously and make an informed buy. Here’s a list of ingredients you must avoid at all costs:Widely used as preservatives to prevent the growth of bacteria, mold and yeast in personal care products, parabens contain oestrogen-mimicking properties that have been linked with an increased risk of breast cancer. Found in makeup, body washes, deodorants, shampoos and facial cleansers, these toxins are absorbed by your skin and cause deadly diseases. But one cannot stop using these essentials altogether, right? Yes, but one can for sure turn to the alternatives - organic, handmade, paraben-free variants like this All Natural Neem Soap , which is made of everything natural and safe like glycerin,neem extract, neem oil, basil essential oil, basil natural fragrance. It is especially free of parabens.Like we said, read labels. If it mentions things like FD&C or D&C, the product contains artificial colours. In this case, F represents food and D&C represent drugs & cosmetics. Usually, these letters are followed by a colour and number, for example, D&C Red 27 or FD&C blue 1. So far so good, right? Not so fast. These are synthetic colours that may have been derived from petroleum or coal tar sources and have dreadfully been linked to ADHD in children. In fact, they’re banned in many countries of the world. Trust only products such as this Rose Water Facial Toner that boasts of having been made with one ingredient only - 100% pure rose water steam, and is free from phthalates, parabens, sulfates, mineral oil, alcohol, and synthetic dyes.While most of us are fond of fragrances and make many purchases basis how fruity, sweet, amazing the product smells, know that the term was created to mask ‘secret (read: harmful) formula.’ Beware that under the mention of fragrance, the brand could be hiding many hazardous chemicals that can be linked with allergies, dermatitis, respiratory distress and potential effects on the reproductive system. Pay special attention to the ingredient list while picking perfumes, colognes, conditioners, shampoos, body washes and moisturizers.Similarly, a group of chemicals used to increase the flexibility and softness of plastics called phthalates are often hidden under the disguise of ‘fragrance’. One of the most commonly used phthalates are dibutyl phthalate used in nail polish, diethyl phthalate in perfumes and lotions, and dimethyl phthalate in hair sprays. These are all known to be endocrine disruptors and have been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer and reproductive birth defects in males and females.Steer clear of such ‘secret formulae’ by choosing conscious brands that do not keep their ingredients inconspicuous such as this Hair & Scalp Care Shampoo and Himalayan Pink Salt Calamine Handmade Soap But the bad news is that Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) / Sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are found in 90% of commercial personal care products. SLS may even react with other chemicals to create nitrosamines, a carcinogen. Such deadly combinations may lead to severe issues like kidney and respiratory damage. Many of your shampoos, body washes/cleansers, mascaras and acne medications contain them. But not this Red Wine & Silk Cleanser , which is completely free from chemical additives and is only made using natural ingredients.While it is not possible to avoid every single chemical or product laden with toxins completely, we can always be careful and make a conscious effort to buy things full of goodness and purity. Be sure to eat clean, avoid processed foods and products, and shop consciously on Qtrove.com - the platform of goodness that lists local sellers who make sustainable, organic products for the conscious consumer in you.Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of Qtrove.com by Times Internet’s Spotlight team."

ELSS Funds : 5 Things to Keep in Mind Before Investing in ELSS Funds for Tax Saving,,"1) Lock-in period

2) Risk

3) Equity investment experience

4) Section 80C allows only Rs 1.5 lakh of investment

5) Be realistic about returns

How safe is investing in ELSS funds?

ELSS funds are one of safe ways to have exposure in equity market compared to directly investing in Equities. It is advisable to do a SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) in ELSS rather than investing a lumpsum amount as it would factor in the market fluctuations and reduces the risk. Why ELSS is considered as a good investment option?

Equity Linked Savings Scheme, commonly called ELSS is a type of diversified equity mutual fund which is qualified for tax exemption under section 80C of the I-T Act. It offers the twin-advantage of capital appreciation and tax benefits. Hence, ELSS makes a very good investment option for tax saving as well as investment. Is maturity of ELSS taxable or not?

Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) qualify for tax deductions of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of Income Tax Act. Is there a lock-in period for ELSS funds?

Yes, ELSS funds have a lock-in period of three years.

Equity Linked Saving Schemes or also commonly called as ELSS, are the great options for tax saving investment. But if you are considering investing in the ELSS funds then you should know everything about it.Here's we give you five points that you should know about ELSS funds before you invest into one of these funds:It is a fact that ELSS, the tax saving mutual funds, have the shortest mandatory lock-in period as compared to other investment options available under Section 80C of Income Tax Act. For example, an ELSS has a lock-in period of three years, whereas a Public Provident Fund (PPF) account has 15 years of the lock-in period. However, ELSSs should not be considered a short-term investment product. Your investment horizon in ELSSs should be of at least five to seven years. Also, it is not advisable to take out money out of ELSS funds before 3 years. Consider ELSS funds for long term investment plans.What puts off most of the new investors from ELSS is the fact that it invests mostly in stocks and hence carries a higher risk. But you can minimize the risk by having a long-time investment horizon in ELSS. And that's why it is advisable to keep investing in ELSS even after 3 years of the lock-in period. The only way to beat the volatility of the market and to make superior returns from stocks is by staying invested for a long period.ELSS is an ideal way to begin your investment in the equity market. Since ELSS come with a mandatory lock-in period of three years, it gives investors a chance to get used to the volatility of the stock market. It would be a good equity market debut for many investors for their future investment in other equity mutual fund schemes.The Section 80C of the Income Tax Act allows you to claim the tax deduction on investment up to Rs 1.5 lakh only. The Section 80C is an overcrowded section where many investment options qualify for tax deduction, for example, PPF, EPF, FD, NPS, NSC, ULIP etc. So, you need to calculate before finalizing the amount you would be investing in ELSS funds because, if you invest more than the required amount, it won't give you extra deduction under Section 80C.Yes, ELSSs hold strong potential to offer good returns because they invest mostly in equity stocks. However, you have to be realistic about your expectation from the returns. For better returns, you need to be invested for a longer term."

Tax Saving for salaried: Five tax saving tips for salaried individuals,,"NEW DELHI: Tax planning for salaried employees is easy and simple if do it on time and take care of few important points. The planning for income tax saving should start at the beginning of the financial year i.e. April and not in the months of February and March.

Here are five important points for you to consider to save income tax on your salary:

1) Take full advantage of Section 80C

It is one of the biggest tax saving options for salaried employees. Take a good look at Section 80C to maximize take-home salary and legally lower the tax payout. The Section 80C offers as much as Rs 150,000 in terms of tax benefit.

2) Divide Rs 150,000 income tax rebate into different options

Don't invest all Rs 150,000 at one place instead spread it across different suitable options such as insurance, PPF (public provident fund), tax-paying mutual funds, NSC (National Savings Certificate) and so on. The choice of investment tool should be made based on your financial goals, risk profile and income levels.

3) Make the priority list

Don't invest only thinking about saving tax. Choose funds which are essential, for example, life insurance, employee provident fund (EPF), tuition fees and so on. After you are done with these, the next step is to consider in investing tax-saving mutual funds, ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans), ELSSs equity-linked saving schemes). You can also invest in PPF and NSC if you prefer low risk options.

4) Tax benefit under home loans

If case you have taken a home loan, you can claim tax benefits under Section 80C by furnishing proof of principal re-payment on the home loan. You can also claim tax benefits under Section 24 towards interest payment on the home loan.

5) Other options

These are only some of the tax saving options under Section 80C. You can also get the benefit of Section 80C by submitting - HRA rent receipts, medical bills, travel bills, conveyance bills, receipt of health insurance/medical premium, education loan, proof of donation etc.

How and when to revoke home loan tax deductions,,"Lock-in period

The deduction on home loan

A number of sections under income tax falls under the category where you can claim deductions for investments and expenses incurred during the particular financial year. Deductions like these help in bringing down the taxable income and also reduce your tax liability.For further information, in many cases, a lock-in period is specified against which you may have claimed a deduction. In case you fail to observe the lock-in period, the deductions that you availed can be officially cancelled.Here is the detailed information about the lock-in periods that need to be observed if you have claimed deduction against repayment of home loan principal amount.Though there is no as such lock-in period for deduction claimed against interest payment on home loan as per section 24(b) or 80EE, the section 80C(5) (relating to repayment of principal) of the Income Tax Act specifies that if you sell your house within 5 years from the date of purchase, the deduction claimed on principal repayment during previous years gets revoked. In such a scenario, all deductions claimed for the home loan principal repayment under section 80C during the previous years also have to be clubbed and added to income of the year of sale, and be taxed depending on that only.In addition to the home loan principal amount, the stamp duty and registration fee paid for registration of property also qualifies for deduction under section 80C in the year of purchase. If you had claimed registration fee and stamp duty also as deduction, you need to observe 5-year lock-in in such cases too.In case you take a home loan for buying or building a house, the capital repayment and interest paid on the loan qualify for deduction under separate income tax sections. While the principal repayment falls under the section 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and has a total limit of Rs 1.5 lakh a year, the interest payment on home loan qualifies for deduction under section 24 (b) of the Act, with a total limit of Rs 2 lakh a year. There is an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 for interest payment on home loans under section 80EE for the first-time homebuyers."

NPS funds: How to select best NPS funds,,"Though it was thrown open to the public eight years ago, investors started showing interest in the National Pension System (NPS) only two years ago. Almost 80% of the 4.39 lakh voluntary subscribers joined the scheme only in the past two years. Also, 75% of the 5.85 lakh corporate sector investors joined NPS in the past four years. Clearly, these investors have been attracted by the tax benefits offered on the scheme. Four years ago, it was announced that up to 10% of the basic salary put in the NPS would be tax free. The benefit under Section 80CCD(2d) led to a jump in the corporate NPS registrations. The number of subscribers shot up 83%: from 1.43 lakh in 2012-13 to 2.62 lakh in 2013-14.

What is NPS?

Two years ago, the government announced an additional tax deduction of `50,000 under Sec 80CCD(1b). The number of voluntary contributors shot up 148% from 86,774 to 2.15 lakh. It turned into a deluge after the 2016 Budget made 40% of the NPS corpus tax free, with the number of subscribers in the unorganised sector more than doubling to 4.39 lakh. This indicates that tax savings, define the flow of investments in India. However, many investors are unable to decide which pension fund they should invest in. The problem is further compounded by the fact that the NPS investments are spread across 2-3 fund classes.

How to calculate NPS?

So, we studied the blended returns of four different combinations of the equity, corporate debt and gilt funds. Ultrasafe investors are assumed to have put 60% in gilt funds, 40% in corporate bond funds and nothing in equity funds. A conservative investor would put 20% in stocks, 30% in corporate bonds and 50% in gilts. A balanced allocation would put 33.3% in each class of funds, while an aggressive investor would invest the maximum 50% in the equity fund, 30% in corporate bonds and 20% in gilts.

Ultra safe investors

Bond funds of the NPS have generated over 12% returns in the past one year, but the performance has not been good in recent months. The average G class gilt fund of the NPS has given 0.55% returns in the past six months. The change in the RBI stance on interest rates pushed up bond yields significantly in February, which led to a sharp decline in bond fund NAVs.

Before they hit a speed bump, gilt and corporate bond funds had been on a roll. Rate cuts in 2015-16 were followed by demonetisation, which boosted the returns of gilt and corporate bond funds. Risk-averse investors who stayed away from equity funds and put their corpus in gilt and corporate bond funds have earned rich rewards.

How to invest in NPS

Unsurprisingly, the LIC Pension Fund is the best performing pension fund for this allocation. “Team LIC has rich experience in the bond market and is perhaps the best suited to handle bond funds,” says a financial planner.

The gilt funds of NPS usually invest in long-term bonds and are therefore very sensitive to interest rate changes. Going forward, the returns from gilt and corporate bond funds will be muted compared to the high returns in the past.

Conservative investors

In the long term, a 100% debt allocation is unlikely to beat inflation. This is why financial planners advise that at least some portion of the retirement corpus should be deployed in equities. Conservative investors in the NPS, who put 20% in equity funds and the rest in debt funds, have also earned good returns. Though the short-term performance has been pulled down by the debt portion, the medium- and long-term performances are quite attractive.

Here too, LIC Pension Fund is the best performer because 80% of the corpus is in debt. It has generated SIP returns of 10.25% in the past 3 years. NPS funds for government employees also follow a conservative allocation, with a 15% cap on equity exposure.

How to apply for national pension scheme?

These funds have also done fairly well, beating the 100% debt-based EPF by almost 200-225 basis points in the past five years. Incidentally, the LIC Pension Fund for Central Government employees is the best performer in that category. Debt-oriented hybrid mutual funds, also known as monthly income plans, have given similar returns.

However, this performance may not be sustained in future. The equity markets could correct and the debt investments might also give muted returns.

Balanced investors

Balanced investors who spread their investments equally across all three fund classes have done better than the ultra-safe and conservative investors. The twin rallies in bonds and equities have helped balanced portfolios churn out impressive returns. Though debt funds slipped in the short term, the spectacular performance of equity funds pulled up the overall returns. Reliance Capital Pension Fund is the best performer in the past six months with 4.03% returns, but it is Kotak Pension Fund that has delivered the most impressive numbers over the long term. Its three-year SIP returns are 10.39% while five-year SIP returns are 11.22%. For investors above 40, the balanced allocation closely mirrors the Moderate Lifecycle Fund. This fund puts 50% of the corpus in equities and reduces the equity exposure by 2% every year after the investor turns 35. By the age of 43, the allocation to equities is down to 34%. However, some financial planners argue that since retirement is still 15-16 years away, a 42-43-year olds should not reduce the equity exposure to 34-35%. But it is prudent to start reducing the risk in the portfolio as one grows older.

Aggressive investors

Aggressive investors, who put the maximum 50% in equity funds and the rest in gilt and corporate bond funds have earned the highest returns, with stock markets touching their all-time highs. Kotak Pension Fund gave 16.3% returns in the past year. The best performing UTI Retirement Solutions has given SIP returns of 11.78% in five years. Though equity exposure has been capped at 50%, young investors can put in up to 75% of the corpus in equities if they opt for the Aggressive Lifecycle Fund. It was introduced late last year, (along with a Conservative Lifecycle Fund that put only 25% in equities), and investors who opted for it earned an average 10.8% in the past 6 months.

But the equity allocation of the Aggressive Lifecycle Fund starts reducing by 4% after the investor turns 35. The reduction slows down to 3% a year after he turns 45. Even so, by the late 40s, his allocation to equities is not very different from the Moderate Lifecycle Fund. Critics say investors should be allowed to invest more in equities if they want.

Step 5:

How to compute GST return?

This can be done by subtracting the comprehensive GST you have paid on your purchases and expenses (available on the box 14 on your return) from the holistic GST you have received from your sales and income (available on the box 10 on your return). How many GST returns are available to claim?

A regular business can file either monthly returns or annual returns under GST. The total of this comes to around 26 returns in a single financial year. How to calculate late fees for GST?

There is a penalty of 5% of the balance owing plus the 1% of your balance owing for each full month your return is late, subject to a maximum of 12-month time-period. Is GST computed on MRP?

Yes, MRP or maximum retail price is inclusive of all taxes including GST too. No retailer can charge GST over and above the MRP.

The new Goods and Services Tax (GST) has changed the way businesses use to bill their clients and or customers. If you are one those wondering how to calculate GST returns , here is a step by step guide for you:The first step is to find the exact slab rate for the goods or services under the GST Act. To find GST Rate , you will have to determine the type of supply item, i.e., whether is it a good or a service. If the supply is a good, find the HSN Code and if the transaction involves the supply of a service, then find the SAC Code.Once you know the HSN or SAC Code, then find out under which slab of GST tax rate the supply fits into. The GST Council has created 5 different slab rates at NIL/0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% for both goods and services.Once you know the GST rate, next find out the applicability of IGST or CGST and SGST. To do so, you need to determine the place of supply first. Mostly, the place where the supply of goods or services was done would be the address where the goods or the service was provided. But in case of e-commerce or OIDAR services, the determination of the place of supply is a more complex issue.Under GST rule, the supplier of the goods or service can collect tax from the recipient and remit the same to the government. However, there are some services like 'reverse charge services', where the recipient is made liable for payment of GST.According to new GST rules, suppliers must maintain extensive accounts, records and file 3 GST forms in a month. However, small businesses having a turnover of less than Rs 75 lakhs, can enrol under the GST Composition Scheme and pay a flat GST based on their aggregate turnover. You should check whether your supplier is enrolled under GST Composition Scheme or not.Next is to find out the type of transactions, for example - Business to Business; Business to Consumer where the value of supply is more than Rs 2.5 lakhs; or Business to Consumer where the value of supply is less than Rs 2.5 lakhs."
GST benefits: What are the advantages of GST ( Goods and Services Tax),,"Eliminates cascading effect of tax

GST has subsumed more than a dozen taxes that existed before the new tax regime. This helps in eliminating the cascading effect of taxes. Cascading effect refers to the situation where a taxpayer needs to pay taxes on taxes.

Higher threshold of taxpayers

Under the previous taxation system, any business with a turnover of more than Rs 5 lakh (in most states) was liable to pay VAT. Also, service tax was exempted for service providers with a turnover of less than Rs 10 lakh.

Under GST regime, however, this threshold has been increased to Rs 20 lakh, which exempts many small traders and service providers.

Small businesses

Over a period of time, government has provided reliefs to small businessmen and taxpayers as far as rate of tax and compliance of filing tax is concerned. Under GST, small businesses (with a turnover of Rs 20 to 75 lakh) can benefit as it gives an option to lower taxes by utilizing the Composition scheme. This move has brought down the tax and compliance burden on many small businesses.

Simpler and Lesser Number of Compliances

Compliance will be simpler through the harmonisation of tax rates, procedures, and laws. Synergies and efficiencies are expected across the board thanks to common formats/forms, common definitions, and common interface via the GST portal. Inter-state disputes such as those on e-commerce taxation and entry tax that currently prevail will no longer cause concerns, while multiple taxation on the same transactions will also be removed. Compliance costs will also reduce as a result.

The previous tax regime had service tax and VAT, and they both had their own compliances and returns. GST will merge them and lower the number of returns as well as the time spent on tax compliances. GST has around 11 returns under it. Four of them are basic returns that are applicable to all taxable entities under GST. Although the number of returns could increase, the main GSTR-1 shall be manually populated, while GSTR-2, GSTR-3, AND GSTR-4 shall be auto-populated.

"
GSTR1 Filing: What is GSTR1 &amp; How to File it Online?,,"What is meant by GSTR1?

Simply put, GSTR1 is a monthly statement of outward supplies to be crafted by all normal and casual registered taxpaying individuals who are engaged in outward supplying of goods and services and possess information related to these outward supplies. Is it mandatory to file GSTR1?

Business owners who have a comprehensive income of more than Rs 2,50,000 are required compulsorily to file income tax returns under GSTR1. How do GSTR1 and GSTR2 differ from each other?

While GSTR1 is the monthly statement of outward supplies of goods or services filed by registered individuals, the GSTR2 return reflects the accrual of the input tax credit from the inputs collected at some point of the prior month. What is the late fee for GSTR1?

The penalty or the late fee for not filing GSTR1 is Rs 200 per day that includes Rs 100 for CGST Act and Rs 100 for SGST Act.

GSTR-1 is a monthly or quarterly return to be filed by regular dealers, the return of which is divided into 13 sections. It is the base document upon which the entire compliance structure of GST is based.For traders with turnover upto Rs 1.5 crore annually, GSTR-1 needs to be filed on quarterly basis while that for traders having turnover above that needs to be filed every month. The late fee for filing GSTR-1 is Rs 50 per day after the due date, and Rs 20, in case of nil returns.Once GSTR-1 return is filed, a trader does not need to pay any tax immediately. The tax has to be paid at the time of filing GSTR-3B (until March 2018).Composition dealers need not file GSTR-1. Such traders need to file GSTR-4 every quarter.GSTR-1 is filed in FORM GSTR-1. The various details included in GSTR-1 are:(i) Invoice wise details of Inter-State and Intra-State supplies made to registered persons and Inter-State supplies with invoice value more than two and a half lakh rupees made to unregistered persons.(ii) Consolidated details of Intra-State supplies made to unregistered persons for each rate of tax and State wise Inter-State supplies with invoice value upto two and a half lakh rupees made to unregistered persons for each rate of tax.(iii) Debit and Credit notes, if any, issued during the month for invoices issued previously."

Today, 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' completes 25 years. Four days ago, 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' completed 22 years. Farida Jalal is one of the common links between the two movies; Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Karan Johar of course being the other three.ETimes got into a long conversation with the senior actress who has seen more than 5 decades of Indian cinema on Friday evening. Here are the excerpts from what we spoke:Oh, I would love to do it all over again. People who are fond of me and are in love with my work feel that I have not been given my due. And they tell me this upfront. Honestly I've got a lot of respect and adulation. But yes, there is little remorse somewhere in my heart that I could have done more. There's so much more that I could have offered, a lot of it was just not tapped at all. I will be taking it all away with me the day I go from here.As an actor, you can fit into several kinds of roles. I put in so much variety in all the mother roles I did and yet they didn't give me anything different. And that's sad. Else I would have done more and you would have been more proud of me (laughs).Look at the male counterparts- Anupam Kher, Om Puri and Paresh Rawal. They were cast opposite me. And now look at the fact that they have got to do a villain's role, comedian's role, lawyer's role, doctor's role. And their body language was so different in all. What haven't they done? But what about the women? Why aren't we given those opportunities?I am told by people that I have a very good dialogue delivery and know how to modulate my voice very well. But... (trails off).Having said that, I am in a happy space. I am happy that I have been around for so long. I love my life. I love my film industry. I hate what's going on at this moment. I don't want to get there but it hurts deeply because I am in love with my profession. Creative people are much better off in the rest of the world.I hope and pray that it happens. But yeah, a little bit has started to happen in that direction. But again, that's happening for only the leading ladies. What about the character artistes?What is she getting? To play a mother, na? I saw her in 'Badhaai Ho' and she was wonderful. But doesn't it all boil down to essaying just a mother's part, in her case as well? I would like to see Neena playing the lead in a hard-hitting, woman-oriented film. That's because she's a good actress and she'll do a great job.(Laughs) These are the movies that gave me awards.It should be beyond that. But you see, it boils down to the hits you deliver. 'Paras', 'Henna' and 'DDLJ' were all big hits.'Mammo', which was a delight. I have tremendous affection and respect for Shyam Benegal ji. I very much remember when I had gone to meet him, he kept the script of 'Mammo' in my lap and said, ""This is the script of 'Mammo' and you are 'Mammo'."" I was dumbfounded. I had gone to meet him while I was on my way to do some shopping in South Mumbai with mom. I came down and told my mother that I am not interested in doing any shopping and we should return home.On my way back, I was reading the script right from the beginning. That's what happens when an actor wants to do something different and gets what he wants.'Mammo' was a great experience. To top it, God gave me an award for it. I couldn't have asked for more. I was told by Shyam Benegal ji and Khalid Mohamed (writer of 'Mammo') that they had Waheeda Rehman ji in mind for the 'Mammo' role. Didn't know why she didn't want to do it. And then Surekha Sikri was supposed to play my younger sister but they felt that I looked very young, So, Surekha ji eventually played my older sister. All that had to happen, but the end result was lovely.Frankly, I didn't do any homework for 'Mammo'. I had started living the role before I landed up on the sets. So, I just went with the flow. It came to me, very naturally.Before 'Aaradhna', I had done Rajshri Productions' 'Taqdeer' (1967). The Rajshri guys are from a different planet. They give you so much respect; everything in that company is something else. Aaradhna was my second film. Auditions un dinno mein hote hi nahi the. There were so many girls vying for the role. But when I finally was happy that I had got the role, let me tell you that I was nervous about romancing on screen. In that romantic song in 'Aaradhna' with Rajesh Khanna ji 'Baago mein bahaar hai' where I come out as a very coy girl, I wasn't putting on any act. I was actually feeling very shy. So to answer your question, yes I did nurse that thought. But it didn't happen. And then, I went on to do 'Gopi' wherein I played Dilip Kumar saab's sister.On the other hand, I remember Mumtaz not getting a heroine's role too, at least for some time. She was getting roles opposite Dara Singh and Mehmood. It was Mehmood who saw the spark in her and he went to Dilip saab and recommended her name. He requested Dilip saab, who said 'Ok, let me see'. And the next thing you knew, she was cast opposite Dilip saab in 'Ram Aur Shyam'. After that, the heroes who had earlier said 'no' to working with Mumtaz were all ready for that! That's the way it goes! You need a man to do a little 'himmat' for you I guess, which Mehmood did in case of Mumtaz.Well, I would have had my rules consisting of certains dos and don'ts. I would have never crossed the lines, not for anything else in this world.Right. And, it is justified that today's heroines should get as much as heroes do. But then they (makers) turn around and tell you to keep quiet as it is the hero who brings commercial viability. What can you argue then? That's true as well, na? Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar , Salman Khan, Hrithik Roshan- aren't these actors really big? Don't films indeed run on their name?I married Tabrez Barmavar in '78 (co-star in 'Jeevan Rekha'). If you trace back, that exactly was the time when multi-starrers had become almost the order of day. Amitabh Bachchan, Shatrughan Sinha, Shashi Kapoor, Parveen Babi, Hema Malini...they were all doing it. What work would I have landed up with, in that milieu? I definitely didn't want a teeny-weeny appearance opposite a comedian- be it anybody. The comedian would have been doing everything and I would have had to just stand in the frame. The actor in me would have died. I refused thousands of roles of those kinds. One day, Mehmood called up my mother to ask what was wrong that I was not taking up films opposite him. He asked if money was the bone of contention. We told him that we didn't want to get into that lane and he understood. I did go on to do 'Paras' opposite Mehmood but that was a meaty role.Of course! She sang all the songs and I did all the work.While I was in Bangalore I did the TV serial 'Ghar Jamai'. Then, the producer of 'Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi'came all the way to Bangalore to ask me if I could do 'YJHZ'. This producer, S S Oberoi his name, was a friend of my husband. He said he wanted a known face opposite Shafi Inamdar else TRPs would drop. My husband said 'Hello?' as he didn't want me to do it. But I was dying to act. Actor kabhi marta hai? Oberoi kept convincing my husband that he would put me in a good hotel, pay me well and I could shuttle at times. Finally, it was sorted that I am doing it. Shooting 'YJHZ' was a picnic, almost the entire shoot was at RajKamal Studios. But what actually brought me back was Raj Kapoor's 'Henna'. I had done 'Bobby' with Rajji and Daboo (Randhir) and Chintu (Rishi) are like brothers to me. I can never forget how I chilled at RK Studios if there was time between my scenes. Rajji used to send me upstairs to see whichever movies from his RK library I wanted to see. And, he told me after 'Bobby' that I will have to come back whenever he calls me. See how promises are kept!Post Heena, the Kapoors had a party at the Taj. At the party, I couldn't believe that filmmakers were walking up and talking to me about several projects, ideas and opinions. You can imagine!My husband stayed in Bangalore while I came away, though he joined later at some point.He at least wasn't easy to work with when we did 'Aaradhna'. He would not talk much. I think he was caught up with thinking.about his ownself: 'What's happening around me?' Where am I going?' But then, he was sweet as well. Like he made some balloons to cheer me up once. In fact, after the movie ended, he was extremely good to me. We gelled very well at the award functions. Initially though, I didn't get the vibes.'DDLJ': I would find out if the boy is good. If he is, I would tell my daughter to go ahead with him. It's her life, after all.'Kya Kehna!': It was a situation that the girl (Preity Zinta) finds herself in because it just happened. I would stand by my daughter all the way in such situations.I recall this scene from 'K2H2' which was shot in Ooty and it was a scene which is so reflective of real life. It's where I tell Kajol to firmly tell Shah Rukh Khan about her feelings for him. I tell her that men don't let emotions rule over their principles. As for 'DDLJ' again it's a scene with Kajol where I tell her that her father will not understand her feelings of love for Shah Rukh.And, I can't forget that scene where I suddenly come into the frame and the camera first focuses on my hands when Hrithik is struggling to tie his shoe laces in 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham'.I held Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar's hand when they were beginners. Now, they should be there for me. But whenever they've called, I have gone. Like, the short film for YRF, 'Happy With Love Shots', was one example. And, I loved when Karan Johar himself called me to do 'Student Of Year'; he could have easily told one of his team members instead to call me. I loved that moment when his number flashed on my mobile and he told me that he has told his team that if and when he has any movie for me, he himself will call.Nope, but he plans to produce and direct films.The essence and soul is missing. There is talent no doubt, but their concentration on social media must decrease."

lazy and inefficient.Oh, mother of all the world and giver of all that is good,It is easy for you to excuse me,For a bad son may be born but there can be no bad mother.Oh mother, you have many great sons in this wide world,And in their midst I happen to be retarded and lost,But oh mother, it is not proper for you to leave me out,For a bad son may be born but there can be no bad mother.Oh, God of all worlds, Neither have I done service at your feet,Nor have I given in charity immeasurable wealth,But you have to shower your incomparable affection on me,For a bad son may be born but there can be no bad mother.In this age past fifty, leaving the worship of other devas,Due to several problems of service and worries,I have approached you for your grace.If you do not take mercy on me at this stage,What is the protection for me who is without any supportThat god Pasupathi who applies ash from cremation ground,Who eats poison, who wears no cloths,Who wears a garland of serpent and who has a begging bowl,Who has not washed or combed his hair and who is god of devils,Has attained the position of the Lord of the universe.Is it not Bhavani, because he has married you?I am not interested in salvation nor in great wealth,I am not interested in knowledge, science or pleasures,Hey mother, I beg of you that I should spend this life,Chanting thy names like Mrudani, Rudrani and Bhavani.Oh Mother, Syama, I have never worshipped thee,Following the rules laid out for worship,And also I have abused you by using cruel words,And still if you have a little mercy on this orphan,It is because of your graceful and merciful conduct.Hey mother of the world,Why is it surprising that you,Have lot of mercy on me,For no mother neglects her son,Even if he has done several mistakes.There is no sinner like me,Nor is there anyone like you,Who can pardon all these great sins,Oh goddess great, understand these both,And do whatever you think is fit."

Chaitra Navratri is celebrated in the Hindu month of Chaitra (March and April), while Sharad navratri is celebrated in autumn around the months of October-November.This year, Navratri festival starts on Saturday, October 17, 2020, and Navami Puja will be observed on Saturday, October 24, 2020. The Vijayadashami and immersion of Maa Durga idol will be observed on Sunday, October 25, 2020.Navratri festival is celebrated for nine-nights and hence most of the people keep fast for nine days. While some people keep fast only during the first two or the last two days of the Navratri. This year, Navratri fasting begins on Saturday, October 17, and Navratri Parana will be observed on Sunday, October 25, 2020."

He will complete a year in office on November 28.

Thackeray was addressing the party’s annual Dussehra rally from the Veer Savarkar auditorium in Shivaji Park with limited attendance. The rally was shifted indoors keeping the Covid safety protocol in mind.

In a no-holds-barred attack on the BJP in his Dussehra rally speech, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said at a time when the country was in the grips of a pandemic, “a peculiar thing is happening”, the Centre’s focus is on toppling governments in non-BJP ruled states. The nation is on the verge of chaos because of the BJP’s unbridled greed for power, he said, “They (the BJP) have been deceiving their partners. The NDA is finished. They talk of friendship and later stab their friends in the back. They will treat Nitish Kumar in a similar fashion after the assembly polls in Bihar.”

The chief minister, targeted by the BJP for not re-opening places of worship, said Sena’s Hindutva was not confined to the symbolism of cymbals and lamps. “Trouncing terrorists is the Sena’s idea of Hindutva,” he declared.

Thackeray quoted from Mohan Bhagwat’s Dussehra speech in which the RSS Sar Sanghchalak said praying in temples or performing poojas should not be equated with Hindutva. “All those writing letters to me should pay heed to Bhagwat first,” he said in a not-so-oblique reference to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s recent letter in which he questioned the Sena’s commitment to Hindutva while demanding that places of worship be re-opened.

Thackeray also slammed the BJP over its free vaccine promise to people of Bihar if it retained power. “You are talking about giving free vaccines in Bihar. Is the rest of the country a part of Pakistan or Bangladesh?” Thackeray asked.

Referring to the Sushant Singh Rajput case, Thackeray said that those “crying for justice for Bihar’s son” are “indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra’s son, ( Aaditya Thackeray ) and the Mumbai police.”

“A lot of mudslinging was on the government, on our family and even on Aaditya. However, since we were clean we didn’t have to worry, but those indulging in these tricks stink of the cow’s urine,” said Thackeray.

The CM said the Modi government hasn’t helped the state financially despite several natural disasters since June, and has also not paid Rs 38,000 crore worth of GST dues to the state. He urged CMs of all states to sink party differences and exert pressure on the Centre to undertake a comprehensive review of GST.

“When they were introducing GST we were opposed to it. It is a flawed system. I appeal to CMs of other states to come ahead for a discussion on the issue. GST should be scrapped if it is not working, and the earlier tax collection system regime should be revived,” he said.

Thackeray said in the recent past many have tried to defame the state and city. “Someone said Mumbai is like PoK… they come to Mumbai for work and then defame the city. This amounts to namak harami,” said Thackeray without naming Kangana Ranaut. “A narrative has been painted to show that the entire city and the state is a drug haven. Everyone here is a drug addict. Any attempt to defame Mumbai and the state will be dealt with strictly,” said Thackeray.

"For a Nitish-free Bihar, back BJP where LJP isn’t in fray: Chirag Paswan",,"NEW DELHI: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan posed a fresh challenge for the NDA in Bihar on Sunday as he appealed to his supporters to vote for BJP wherever his party has not put up a candidate for a “Nitish free” government.This came two days after Paswan thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for remembering his father in a joint rally of BJP and JD(U).In an early morning tweet, Paswan said, “I request you all to vote for LJP candidates where they are contesting to implement Bihar1st Bihari1st and in the rest of the places, vote for BJP. The next government will be a Nitish free government.”Paswan took another swipe at Bihar CM Nitish Kumar by referring to a full page advertisement of BJP with only the PM’s photograph. Though the advertisement had the symbols of all four parties in the NDA, Paswan said, “I am happy that BJP’s advertisement has only the PM’s photograph. My BJP friends have realised that putting Nitish Kumar’s photograph is causing harm.”BJP leaders have said Paswan was trying to create confusion and the saffron party had no ties with the regional outfit. LJP has put up 138 candidates and 122 of them are against JD(U) and its ally, Jitin Ram Manjhi’s HAM. It has very few nominees against BJP."
India wants Pakistan to prosecute David Headley for 26/11,,"David Coleman Headley (File photo)

NEW DELHI: India wants Pakistan to prosecute Pakistan-American David Coleman Headley , and seek his testimony as a witness, in the 2008 Mumbai attacks case, TOI has learnt.

The government conveyed this to Islamabad last week, while reiterating that India is open to hosting a Pakistan judicial commission for examining witnesses in Mumbai or to questioning them through a teleconference.

The 26/11 plotter who pleaded guilty is serving a 35-year sentence in the US for planning terror attacks in Denmark and India. India believes though his deposition before Pakistan authorities, exposing Pakistan's ISI links with the perpetrators, will set to rest any doubt whatsoever about the role of Pakistan state actors in the attacks that left 166, including 6 Americans, dead.

Headley has confessed before both US and Indian agencies that he acted at the behest of ISI and that the terror group responsible for the attack, LeT, was acting under the same spy agency's umbrella.

That he turned approver and pleaded guilty, while leading to his conviction by a US court, also meant that under the US laws he can no longer be extradited to India, or to Pakistan in the unlikely event of Islamabad acting on India's advice and seeking his prosecution.

Not being extradited to India, Pakistan or Denmark was one of the conditions on which the rogue US intelligence agent had turned approver.

In his plea bargain, Headley had agreed though that, when directed by the US attorney’s office, he would ""fully and truthfully"" testify in any foreign judicial proceedings held in the United States by way of deposition, videoconferencing or letters rogatory. This opens the door for Pakistan to implead Headley.

At a time it remains worried about the fate of the inordinately delayed trial in Pakistan of the other 26/11 accused, including LeT commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, India is keen that the links of ISI and other military officers with the attacks are foregrounded again in he form of a virtual Headley testimony. The need for Pakistan to bring the Mumbai attacks accused to justice is again likely to figure in the 2+2 ministerial dialogue with the US Tuesday. India has also continued to emphasise that Pakistan hasn't yet stopped promoting cross-border terrorism.

After he was made an accused in the Mumbai attacks, Headley testified virtually before a Mumbai special court and named one Major Ali and another Major Iqbal, both from ISI, as his handlers in Pakistan.

Headley had revealed that his reconnaissance missions to India were ordered by Major Iqbal and that, before his September 2006 visit to India, he had received $ 25,000 from Iqbal. He had also said that he got 40,000 in Pakistani currency from LeT operative Sajid Mir between April and June 2008.

Admitting that he worked for ISI and LeT, Headley had identified ISI official Brigadier Riyaz as Lakhvi, the Mumbai attacks mastermind. He also named 3 other ISI officials - Colonel Shah, Lt Colonel Hamza and Major Samir Ali - who, he said, were working with LeT and Al Qaeda.

India had in August this year again offered to host a judicial commission from Pakistan after Islamabad sent a list of 27 witnesses the anti-terror court hearing the case wants to examine. The government though has rejected the demand that the witnesses visit Pakistan, saying that Pakistan could also consider examining them through a video conference.

The Mumbai trial was initiated after Pakistan in 2009 arrested seven men directly involved in the terror attack. Apart from Lakhvi, Abdul Wajid, Mazhar Iqbal, Hamad Amin Sadiq , Shahid Jameel Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Younis Anjum are facing charges of abetment to murder, attempted murder, planning and executing the 2008 attacks. India has remained sceptical about the outcome though, not least because of Pakistan's refusal to act against JuD chief Hafiz Saeed, who is also accused of masterminding the Mumbai attacks.

"Livid at delay in completion of NHAI building, Nitin Gadkari puts ‘non performers’ on notice",,"Union minister Nitin Gadkari (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday slammed the ""non-performing"" officials in the national highways authority of India (NHAI) who have been either delaying projects or posing obstacles in works . He said such ""non performing assets"" should be shown the exit door.

Gadkari was speaking at the inauguration of the new NHAI building, which was built in nine years. He said this was an example of how officials have developed the habit of delaying works and even warned that he would have no other option than reviewing the performance of the chief general managers (CGM) and general managers (GMs).

""Non-performing assets (NPAs) not worth doing even vermiculture are preserved here and are being promoted. I feel ashamed at the attitude of such officials who are carrying such legacies of negativity and delaying things. They are delaying decisions and creating complications and at the helm, these are CGMs and GMs sitting for 12-13 years,"" Gadkari said.

He said he was feeling ""ashamed"" at the inordinate delay by senior NHAI officials who were responsible for such a small work taking more than nine years while the same agency is building Delhi-Mumbai expressway with investment of Rs 1 lakh crore in three years.

Gadkari said the very process of recruitment in NHAI was faulty and the agency had been getting “bad raw material”. He also flagged how senior level officials often don’t have details of projects.

“I will have no option else than assessing the performance of officials. I need to fix the issue and get rid of non-performing persons,” he said.

The minister wondered as to why the authority was not able to retain engineers from IITs and other institutes.

PDP trio flags Mehbooba’s ‘undesirable’ remarks,,"SRINAGAR: In the first sign of a rift within PDP over party chief Mehbooba Mufti's refusal to hoist the tricolour till J&K's erstwhile flag was restored, three senior Jammu-based functionaries on Monday shot off a letter in which they spoke about ""feeling quite uncomfortable over some of her actions and undesirable utterances that have hurt patriotic sentiments"".

As the backlash against Mehbooba hit home, a BJP trio from north Kashmir's Kupwara was detained by Srinagar police for ""violating Covid-prevention norms"" while proceeding to hoist the national flag atop the clock tower at Lal Chowk to mark Accession Day.

In Jammu, PDP functionaries TS Bajwa , Ved Mahajan and Hussain A Waffa made no secret of their embarrassment at their party chief's remarks last Friday during her first presser since being released from 14 months in detention. ""We have disagreements on several issues that have been taken up in the letter sent to Mehbooba ji . We want to set things right in the PDP family,"" Bajwa, a former Rajya Sabha member, said.

On reports that he and his two colleagues had quit PDP already, Bajwa said, ""We have not resigned yet. If any decision regarding this is taken, it will be communicated to the media through a press conference.""

Without directly referring to the tricolour, Mehbooba had vowed ""not to raise the other flag till Kashmir's flag is restored"". The former CM also said she wasn't interested in contesting elections until J&K's status was restored to what it was before August 5 last year, when the Centre moved to nullify Articles 370 and 35A.

Protesting against Mehbooba's remarks, including calling the Centre a band of ""robbers"", various BJP units on Monday held rallies across Jammu and in parts of the Valley with the tricolour as the centrepiece. The three BJP members detained in Srinagar while trying to hoist the flag at Lal Chowk – Mir Basharat, Mir Ishfaq and Akhtar Khan – said their mission was to ""send a message to members of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration that only the national flag will remain in Kashmir"".

""Today we came to celebrate the day when Maharaja Hari Singh signed the instrument of accession with the Centre. Our message is for Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah and all other members of the (seven-party) alliance,"" Basharat said.

Srinagar SSP Haseeb Mughal clarified that it was the right of every citizen to hoist the tricolour and that the three BJP functionaries were detained only because their movement towards Residency Road might disrupt traffic and lead to an assembly larger than Covid norms stipulate.

A BJP car rally from Tagore Hall, Srinagar, headed towards Mehbooba's official bungalow on Gupkar Road. BJP youth activists and members of the women's wing hoisted the tricolour at the PDP office in Jammu's Gandhi Nagar.

Addressing a ""tiranga rally"" in Jammu, J&K BJP chief Ravinder Raina said, ""The Gupkar gang is left with no other option than to repent for the sins they have committed so far.""

"BJP seat share in Ladakh council shrinks from 18 to 15, Cong gains 4",,"SRINAGAR: In Ladakh's first electoral exercise since it became a Union Territory, BJP on Monday retained its hold on the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council even as its footprint shrank from 18 seats to 15, with an even bigger setback being the defeat of outgoing chief executive councillor Gyal P. Wangyal . Congress won nine seats out of the 26 at stake, almost doubling its tally of five in the previous council.

All the mainstream regional parties, including National Conference (NC) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP), had boycotted the October 22 polls as part of the campaign for restoration of J&K's special status. In the last Ladakh council polls in 2015, NC had won two seats.

This time, the field included debutant AAP, which contested 19 seats and drew a blank. Two out of the 23 independents in the fray won. Only one independent candidate had won in 2015. Four councillors in the House of 30 are nominated by the government.

Kargil district of Ladakh has a separate hill council that was elected in 2018 for a five-year term.

Officials said 89,776 voters, 45,025 of them women, had exercised their franchise across 294 polling stations in 26 constituencies of Leh district. The turnout was pegged at 65.07 per cent. EVMs were used in the Ladakh council polls for the first time.

In the 2010 polls, BJP had won only four seats while Congress had 22. In the previous council, BJP had 17 seats, Congress four and NC two.

After the nullification of Article 370 last year, the BJP-led council had passed a resolution seeking ""safeguards"" for the rights of the indigenous people of Ladakh under Article 371. Buddhist spiritual leader Thupstan Chhewang , who had won the Ladakh LS seat as a BJP candidate for the first time in 2014, thereafter quit the party, calling its promises ""empty rhetoric"".

South Kashmir on path of normalcy: GoC 15 Corps,,"SRINAGAR: Lieutenant General BS Raju , GOC 15 Corps, based in Srinagar, said on Monday that whosoever is holding a gun will face tough action from the Army .

“However, those willing to return to the mainstream by shunning the path of violence, are welcome. We will facilitate their return,"" he promised.

“There is a beautiful environment prevailing in the Valley at present and Kashmir is on the right track,” General Raju told reporters at a function in Yusmarg in Budgam in central Kashmir on Monday.

“I appeal to the youth ready to quit militancy to return as environment is feasible to start a new and peaceful life. Militancy has given nothing to Kashmir. The situation in south Kashmir is normal. Economic activities are picking up there. Apple trade is also picking pace. If Covid-19 subsides, I am sure schools will also re-open there,” General Raju remarked.

About the situation on the LoC, the general said the Army has been able to plug the infiltration to a large extent this year. “Ahead of snowfall and winter, the attempts may increase, but our men are maintaining a tight vigil to foil all bids,” he said.

Delimitation sets base for new Jammu and Kashmir dist development councils,,"SRINAGAR: The J&K administration on Monday notified 280 territorial constituencies –14 each in the 20 districts of the Union Territory – as part of a delimitation exercise to create the framework for elected district development councils (DDCs) under the amended Jammu and Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act.

""After incorporating all the changes in respect of the objections/recommendations which have been accepted, the Election Authority hereby notifies the delimitation of District Development Councils in terms of Rule 108-B,"" states the notification issued by chief electoral officer Hirdesh Kumar.

The draft delimitation proposal had been put in the public domain by the deputy commissioners of all 20 districts for suggestions/objections till October 23.

Solar Eclipse/Surya Grahan: What is solar eclipse and how does it occur?,,"What is a solar eclipse?

A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon. What is a ‘Ring of Fire’ during solar eclipse?

We do not get to see a ‘Ring of Fire’ during all solar eclipses and those solar eclipses where a ‘Ring of Fire’ is visible is called an annular solar eclipse. During such an eclipse, the centre of the Sun is covered by the Moon in such a way that the outer edge of the Sun is left visible and it looks like a ring. When viewed from a long distance it looks like a ring of fire around the Moon called the 'annulus'. However, when an annular solar eclipse takes place, the ‘Ring of Fire’ is not visible from all places on earth. As a result of which the annular solar eclipse may look like a partial solar eclipse. When does an annular solar eclipse happen?

We do not get to see a 'ring of fire' during all solar eclipse. For an annular solar eclipse to take place, three things need to happen — there should be a New Moon, the Moon should be at or very near a lunar node so that the Sun, Moon and the Earth all are in a straight line and the Moon should be near the apogee (the farthest point of the Moon from Earth) so that the outer edge of the Sun is visible. The 'Ring of Fire' is visible only when all these three parameters are met. When will solar eclipse start on Wednesday

According to the India Meteorological Department’s Kolkata-based Positional Astronomy Centre, the solar eclipse will begin at 8am on Thursday. It will slowly increase in intensity before peaking two hours later. It will end at 1.35pm. Places where solar eclipse can be seen

In Delhi, the partial eclipse will begin at 8.17am while the greatest eclipse will start at 9.30. The partial eclipse will end at 10.56am and the total duration of the eclipse will be 2 hours and 39 minutes. The solar eclipse will be at its maximum intensity at 10.47am and will remain so for a little under four minutes. The eclipse will be visible in some parts of India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Sumatra, Australia, Philippines and Singapore. People living in Ooty, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Shivagange, Tiruchirappalli and Kasaragod will be able to see the “ring of fire”. However, residents of New Delhi, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Ludhiana and Agra will only witness a partial solar eclipse. “From India, annular phase will be visible in the morning after sunrise from some places within a narrow corridor of southern part of the country (parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and it will be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. The narrow corridor of annular phase of the eclipse will pass through the southern part of the country through certain places like Kannur, Coimbatore, Kozhikode, Madurai, Mangalore, Ooty, Tiruchirappalli, etc,” a bulletin of the Positional Astronomy Centre stated. Precautions while watching the solar eclipse

“The eclipse should not be viewed with the naked eye. It will cause permanent damage of the eyes even when the moon covers most portion of the sun. Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised Mylar, black polymer and welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the sun’s image on a white board by a telescope,” the bulletin stated. Dos and donts on solar eclipse

Exposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause “eclipse blindness” or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy, say opthalmologists. ""Radiation from the sun is so powerful that regular sunglasses or lens in cameras will not be able to filter,"" says senior opthalmologist Dr Mohan Rajan. ""Looking at the sun for more than 90 seconds exceeds threshold of retinal damage,"" he said. The harmful ultra violet rays from the sun can destroy cells in the retina that transmit what you see to the brain, sometimes causing permanent damage. Many times people it can occur without pain. ""Symptoms can take a few hours to a few days after viewing the solar eclipse to realize the damage that has occurred,"" he said. Many experience loss of central vision (solar retinopathy) , distorted vision or altered color vision. Do not watch the eclipse on * Smartphone * Camera viewfinder, telescope or binoculars * Unsafe filters or glasses. Dos Use specifically designed for viewing a solar eclipse. Follow directions to use carefully

NEW DELHI: Several parts of the country, including Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi, are witnessing a solar eclipse on Thursday morning, which is said to the last one of the decade.The solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, began at around 8:17 am and will continue till 10:57 am today. It is also being referred to as ""ring of fire"" and "" Surya Grahan "" in Hindi.The beginning of the eclipse can be first seen from the Arabian sea coast of Oman at around 7:59 hours IST and the annular eclipse will become first visible in west of Baharain at 09:06 hours IST, Duari added.

What is NPR: All you need to know about National Population Register that could pave way for pan-India NRC,,"What is NPR?

The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more. What is its purpose?

NPR's purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. What are the demographic details required?

Name of person Relationship to head of household, Father’s name, Mother’s name, Spouse’s name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification. What is the current status?

Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government. Which states have blocked NPR?

The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, ""All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal."" Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record 'basic information' on citizens. ""After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC,"" the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week. Why is Assam excluded

As of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens. How can NPR data be accessed

NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.

NEW DELHI: Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved funds to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register ( NPR ), officials have said.The NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of ""usual residents"" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed.Meanwhile, the Left parties announced a seven-day nationwide protest from January 1 to 7 and a general strike on January 8 against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC .In a joint statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party said the protest programme was announced in solidarity with the trade unions, which have also called a general strike on January 8.Now it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam."
All you need to know about National Register of Citizens of India,,"What is NRC ( National Register of Citizens )?

NRC means the National Register of Citizens. NRC is a list of Assam's residents – prepared to identify bonafide residents and deport illegal migrants in the northeastern state bordering Bangladesh. So far, this has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered.But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Many top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and finally deport them where they came from. Who stands to lose?

The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. It essentially means, if a nationwide NRC is implemented as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?

As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRC

Amit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of India

The Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens. A pilot NPR project was launched when the UPA government was in power but was not completed.

In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of India

The Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens. A pilot NPR project was launched when the UPA government was in power but was not completed.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Amid the protests across the country over the amended Citizenship Act, the government has said that there is no link between the new law and NRC. Home minister Amit Shah had earlier set a 2024 deadline for implementing the NRC across the country.Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday clarified that the exercise to prepare an all-India National Register for Citizens — National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003 — was yet to be notified and as and when it is done, rules and instructions would be framed in such a way that no Indian citizen is inconvenienced.Here is all you need to know about the NRC:"

What is RTI Act: RTI Amendment Bill: Explained,,"NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, after division that allows the Central government to notify the term of office for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) with the Opposition slamming the measure as diluting the provisions of the legislation.

The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with 218 members voting in its favour and 79 against it after a reply by Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh.

The 2005 Act was enacted during the first Congress-led government UPA government. According to the activists, the efficacy of the RTI Act , allowing any Indian to seek information from any authority on the payment of Rs 10, hinges closely on the independence of the CIC and its equivalents in the states — state information commissions that adjudicate the matter in case information is not furnished to applicants within the parameters of the law. Here is explain:

What’s changed in Parliament: While Lok Sabha was never a problem, the NDA’s weakling status in the Rajya Sabha prevented it from pushing several contentious bills — with its total strength in the Upper House less than that of the Opposition. However, that may not be a problem any longer as the NDA, along with some ‘friendly’ parties such as the TRS, YSRCP, BJD and others has a strength of 127 in the 245 member House of Elders, more than the halfway mark of 123. That should help it push through the bill after it passes in the Lok Sabha.

What’s in the bill: The amended bill does away with the fixed tenure of five years for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and the Information Commissioners (IC) — instead, they will serve for a tenure determined by the Central government. Moreover, the salary of the CIC and the ICs which are currently benchmarked with the salary of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the Election Commissioners respectively, which in turn are benchmarked with the salary of a Supreme Court judge, amount to Rs 2.50 lakh, along with a monthly allowance of Rs 34,000 per month — plus the usual perks like rent free furnished accommodation and 200 litres of fuel every month. The amended bill gives the government to fix the salary, which could be lower — given that the Information Commission is a statutory body unlike the EC which is a constitutional body. However, the current incumbents’ salaries will not be affected by the amendment.

How will that affect RTI? Currently, the CIC and the IC are chosen by a three member panel of the PM, the Leader of Opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha and a Cabinet minister nominated by the PM. Similarly, the State Chief Information Commissioners (SCIC) and State Information Commissioners (SIC) are chosen by a three member panel comprising the state CM, the state’s leader of opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in the state assembly and a state cabinet minister nominated the chief minister. The amended bill arrogates the power of appointment and the term as well as the salary of SCIC and SIC to the Central government — which nullifies the independence of the state legislatures. Even the CIC and the ICs will serve at the pleasure of the government — raising the possibility that they would be more interested in ensuring the longevity of their tenures rather than serving the citizens’ interests.

Termination of terms? Current rules stipulate that no CIC, IC, SCIC or SIC serve more than one term, for a maximum period of 5 years or till the age of 65, whichever is earlier. For ICs and SICs, if one of them is nominated to the post of CIC or SCIC, his/her total tenure as both IC and CIC or SIC and SCIC can not exceed 5 years. While the new bill gives the government the power to fix tenures, it's not clear whether an incumbent seen as pliable or ‘friendly’ to the Centre may get to serve more than one term.

Appointments & dismissals: If the tenure of the CIC, IC, SCIC and SIC are to be fixed by the Centre, it may follow that their removal from office may also be dependent on the Centre — whereas in the original bill, the CIC and IC may be removed only by the President — and the state Governor in case of SCIC and SIC — after an enquiry by the Supreme Court finds reason for their dismissal from office.

"India, US to ink pact for geospatial intelligence, will help in missile-targeting &amp; navigation",,"India is delighted to host the US Secretary of Defence, Dr. Mark Esper. Our talks today were fruitful, aimed at fu… https://t.co/9HHTLpoKxQ — Rajnath Singh (@rajnathsingh) 1603710711000

NEW DELHI: India is now set to get access to advanced satellite imagery, topographical and aeronautical digital data in real time from the US for further enhancing the accuracy of its missiles and armed drones as well as long-range navigation of military aircraft.The signing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Cooperation (BECA), just days ahead of a bitterly contested US election, reflects the Indian government's close cooperation with the Trump administration as well as its confidence that the pact will enjoy bi-partisan support in America.The access to high quality geospatial data will become possible after India and US ink their fourth and final foundational military pact BECA during the “two-plus-two” dialogue on Tuesday. The two are also set to sign the Maritime Information Sharing Technical Arrangement (MISTA) to enhance cooperation between their navies.The inking of BECA for exchange of highly-classified geospatial intelligence, without the risk of it being compromised, was officially announced after defence minister Rajnath Singh conducted a delegation-level meeting with his US counterpart Mark Esper on Monday afternoon.After a separate meeting with foreign minister S Jaishankar, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said, ""We see each other for what we are: great democracies, global powers, and really good friends.""The two sides discussed several bilateral measures to further enhance their already expansive defence cooperation and intelligence-sharing as well as developments in the Indo-Pacific region in the backdrop of India’s ongoing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh with China.With China indulging in expansionist and belligerent behavior in the entire Indo-Pacific region, Esper also welcomed India’s recent decision to invite Australia to take part in its top-notch trilateral Malabar naval exercise with the US and Japan next month.The inking of BECA will be a major takeaway. India inked the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with the US in 2002, which was followed by the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016, and then the Communications, Compatibility and Security Arrangement (COMCASA) in 2018.TOI had last week reported India and the US were all set to ink BECA, which had been hanging fire for well over a decade, during the two-plus-two dialogue on Tuesday.The previous UPA regime had stonewalled LEMOA, COMCASA and BECA during its 10-year tenure on the ground that it would compromise India’s “strategic autonomy”. In its initial period, UPA was held back by Left being a supporting party. But the NDA government has stressed there are “enough India-specific safeguards” built into these pacts to protect the country’s sovereign interests.LEMOA provides for reciprocal logistics support like refueling and berthing facilities for each other's warships and aircraft, while the COMCASA has paved the way for India to get greater access to advanced military technologies with encrypted and secure communications and data links like armed Predator-B or Sea Guardian drones.There are still some lingering concerns about BECA, especially since India has its own robust satellite imaging capabilities. “But we don’t have the capabilities that provide real-time and accurate data for long-range missile-targeting and navigation,” said an official.The continuing military confrontation with an intransigent China in eastern Ladakh has accelerated the inking of BECA, much like the decision to invite Australia for the Malabar naval exercise last week.The US, of course, is providing military intelligence to India during the current crisis like it did during the 73-day military confrontation at Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction in June-August 2017. “BECA will further smoothen the process,” he said.China will also be in the cross-hairs when the 24th edition of Malabar is held in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea in two phases in the first and third weeks of November. It will mark the first time the “Quad” countries will come together for the combat manoeuvres on the high seas after a gap of 13 years.The US, of course, has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth $21 billion just since 2007, which include the $3 billion ones for 24 MH-60 'Romeo’ naval helicopters and six Apache attack choppers signed during President Donald Trump’s visit here in February."
"Air pollution may hinder India's fight against Covid-19, say scientists",,"More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: The causal link between air pollution and Covid-19 cases is yet to be established conclusively but long-term exposure will certainly make people more vulnerable to lung infections, warn scientists as the skies over large parts of north India, including Delhi, turn smoky and the air quality deteriorates rapidly.Their concerns come amid several global studies pointing to the possible connection between higher air pollution levels and increased Covid-19 cases and deaths.A study by researchers at Harvard University in the US in September showed that an increase of only one microgram per cubic metre in PM 2.5 is associated with an 8 per cent increase in the Covid-19 death rate.“Given the current limited literature, the surge of PM2.5 level in Delhi may be associated with increased Covid-19 cases ... Although the literature is relatively sparse at this stage,” Xiao Wu, corresponding author of the Harvard study, told PTI.He said the relationship between long-term air pollution and Covid-19 has been documented in many studies, which indicate that adverse health impacts of air pollution can make people prone to the infection or exacerbate the severity of Covid-19 symptoms once infected.This is interesting, especially considering Covid-19 causes viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and severe inflammation to the heart and circulatory system, the scientist said.Another study by the University of Cambridge in April found an association between living in an area of England with high levels of air pollution and the severity of Covid-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.“Based on our findings, I would expect to see an association between higher levels of air pollution in India and Covid-19 in the winter, similar with what we found in England,” said Marco Travaglio, corresponding author of the Cambridge study.“If the levels of air pollution have been consistently above the legal limits for several months or years before this coming winter, I would expect to see a relationship between those levels and Covid-19 burden across different parts of India in November and thereafter,” Travaglio told PTI.He noted that a key component of PM2.5 toxicity is its composition which may vary considerably between countries.“Nonetheless, the WHO legal limits for PM2.5 are currently set at 10 µg/m³ (microgrammes per cubic metre) annual mean. Levels beyond 500 µg/m³ are extremely high and may have considerable impact on people's health in relation to Covid-19 but also beyond it,” said Travalgo.The level of small particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in Delhi have averaged around 180-340 µg/m³ in the past few weeks while that of bigger pollution particles (PM10) has hovered between 120 and 450 during the time.Long-term exposure to chronically high PM2.5 levels weakens the ability of the lungs to fend off infections, therefore making people more susceptible to Covid-19, the scientists said.In addition, studies from Italy have shown that traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the genetic material of the virus, can be found on pollution particles, meaning that increased air pollution may act as a vehicle to increase Covid-19 transmission in highly polluted places.The air quality in north India is expected to deteriorate further from November to February due to several factors such as stubble burning, festive fireworks and low wind speed conditions which lead to an uptick in vehicular and industrial pollution being trapped in the lower atmosphere.""In view of this evidence, high levels of PM2.5 in Delhi may lead to a higher number of Covid-19 cases,” Travalgo added.Studies in humans have shown that toxic air particles can penetrate airways and cause widespread infiltration of lung cells.This chronic state of inflammation may induce or aggravate health conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, experts said.Because these conditions have been widely found to be associated with increased risk of contracting Covid-19 or incurring into critical illness, it is likely that air pollution acts as a risk factor to increase the susceptibility to Covid-19.India has the world's second-highest caseload of over 7.9 million and the third-highest death toll with more than 115,000 from the novel coronavirus The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned that Delhi is likely to report around 15,000 Covid-19 cases daily in winter because of the prevalence of respiratory illnesses during this season that worsen the symptoms of the disease. On Sunday, the national capital recorded 4,136 fresh Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in 38 days.D J Christopher, head of pulmonary medicine at the Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu, noted that the increased severe form of Covid-19 among patients would lead to an increased ICU hospitalisations, thereby increasing the burden of the healthcare system.“The lung is the gateway to the body and takes the first impact from inhaled pollutants. It causes an inflammatory response which damages the lung and makes it more susceptible to infections,” Christopher told PTI.'Let us hope the numbers are not so high. There is a chance of hospital beds getting filled and shortage of ICU beds,“ he added.Prof Rajneesh Bhardwaj concurred, saying there is growing scientific evidence that airborne respiratory droplets carrying the virus travel and contaminate the air after an infected person coughs. He added that pollution may help this airborne droplet to remain suspended for a longer time and may increase the spread of Covid-19.“PM2.5 are finer particles which remain suspended in the air for a long time and hence droplet or viral particles can cling on to these particles to increase the risk. They may increase the number of cases as pollution increases especially with large PM2.5 levels,"" Bhardwaj, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, told PTI.He said the government should make contingent plans to deal with an expected large number of cases and warned that any healthcare system can be overwhelmed by a larger number of cases.According to pulmonologist Anurag Agarwal, however, the relation between air pollution and Covid-19 cases is very complex. While in general high air pollution increases risk of respiratory infections, it is difficult to say much more, he said.“Studies finding more infections and deaths in areas with high pollution have tried to statistically adjust for higher population density in polluted cities. Such adjusted correlations are interesting but do not represent proof,” Agarwal, director of the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, told PTI.""Nevertheless, it is clear that air pollution is bad for health and Covid-19 is more dangerous in unhealthy people. So the message is clear - we must take steps to reduce air pollution for many reasons,” he added."

Covid link: Why India's air is cause for concern The causal link between air pollution and Covid-19 cases is yet to be established conclusively but long-term exposure will certainly make people more vulnerable to lung infections, warn scientists as the skies over large parts of north India, including Delhi, turn smoky and the air quality deteriorates rapidly.

So this is something which we are actively looking into,"" Chandra said.He noted that while the subsidiarisation process is on, the company is alongside ""actively looking for a partner"" to create assets and capabilities with a win-win situation for both.When asked about the timelines for both the initiatives, Chandra noted: ""There are no specific timelines..as far as subsidiarisation process is concerned, converting the business into a separate legal entity, we would like to accelerate in a year and as far as partner is concerned it is an active work which we will continue to work on.""On the company's performance in the PV segment, Chandra said that despite lockdown Tata Motors posted double digit growth during the first half of this fiscal.""This has resulted in a market share of 7.9 per cent in the passenger vehicle segment..the company's product range has been appreciated for safety and pleasure of driving,"" he said.Chandra said the PV segment was witnessing growth revival as sales grew by 18 per cent in the July-September quarter this fiscal.""A big part of it is pent up demand which has been a big factor for the growth. There was 20 per cent de growth last year because people wanted to wait for BS-VI products leading to pent up demand in the last year itself. Further two months of lockdown this year has led to huge pent up demand,"" he noted.He added that demand would sustain during the pandemic period due to people preferring personal mobility over public transport.""It remains speculative how the things would turn out to be beyond that and festive season because there is something offsetting these positive trends --pent up demand combined with personal mobility needs.""It is the whole macro economic situation which is not witnessing growth, GDP is expected to see a 10 per cent decline. We will have to see the overall effect of that post the festive season. So far indications are that it will sustain,"" Chandra said."

NEW DELHI: Both coronavirus and common flu have many similar symptoms. So, don't panic. Here is how you can identify the similarities and differences.➤ Both cause fever, cough, fatigue; sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea➤ Can be mild or severe, even fatal in rare cases➤ Can result in pneumonia➤ Both spread through droplets released by an infected person while coughing, sneezing or talking➤ Flu can be spread by an infected person for several days before their symptoms appear; Covid-19 is believed to be spread in the same manner, but we don't yet know for sure➤ Neither virus is treatable with antibiotics, which only work on bacterial infections➤ Both may be treated by addressing symptoms, such as reducing fever.

Coronavirus outbreak: Myth and facts,,"READ ALSO:

Cold weather and snow kill the new coronavirus



There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.



Taking a hot bath prevent the new coronavirus disease



Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that coud occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.



The new coronavirus can be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting COVID-19 cases.



Even though the new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days (depending on the type of surface), it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. If you think a surface may be contaminated, use a disinfectant to clean it. After touching it, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.



The new coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites



To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.



Hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus



Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.



Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?



UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.



How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?



Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.



Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?



No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?



At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans.



Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?



No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.



Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?



No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold . However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.



Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?



Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.



Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?



People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?



No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.



Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?



To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

In order to prevent misinformation from spreading further, WHO has issued a list of myth busters. Here's a look at the most pervasive myths and why they are wrong.What is provided below are myths. They are not true and we should not fall for them ."
"Dubai mandates both pre-departure &amp; on arrival Covid tests for flyers from India, other countries",,"NEW DELHI: Travellers from India and many other countries will need to undertake Covid test twice while going to Dubai. While till now they required a negative report from a RT-PCR test done within 96 hours before flying there, Dubai has added a test on arrival for them. It has also expanded the list of labs in India whose Covid tests will not be accepted and airlines are not supposed board Dubai-bound passengers with reports from these labs.Website of Dubai-based airline Emirates gives the entry rules apply for passengers travelling from countries like India, United States (California, Florida & Texas), Argentina, Bangladesh, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia and several others.“UAE residents must take two COVID‑19 PCR tests: one before departure with a validity of 96 hours from the date of the test, and a second test upon arrival in Dubai. Tourists must take two COVID‑19 PCR tests: One before departure with a validity of 96 hours from the date of the test, and a second test upon arrival in Dubai.”There are separate entry rules, that require one Covid test, for visitors from countries like Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland.“UAE residents have the option to present a negative COVID‑19 PCR test certificate that is valid for 96 hours from the date of the test before departure or take the COVID‑19 PCR test on arrival in Dubai. Tourists must present a negative COVID‑19 PCR test certificate that is valid for 96 hours from the date of the test before departure ‑ except for passengers coming from the UK and Germany who have the option to take a COVID‑19 PCR test on arrival in Dubai,” the Emirates website says.Transiting passengers from these countries are not required to present a COVID‑19 PCR test certificate unless it is mandated by their final destination.Meanwhile, Dubai civil aviation authorities have now increased the number of labs in India from four names earlier to seven now whose test reports will not be considered valid for travel, meaning passenger with negative reports from these labs are not supposed to be accepted for Dubai-bound flights.Sources say the earlier Covid test requirement was of 96 hours before departure. “There were some cases where a person who had a negative report was found to be positive in random testing on arrival in Dubai. While that is something that can genuinely happen as there is lot of time in which a person who was actually Covid negative and got the flu after that and hence tested positive on arrival. However, these instances may have been disproportionately high with some labs and possibly that is why Dubai decided not to recognise their test reports,” said a person in the know."
"Air pollution may hinder India's fight against Covid-19, say scientists",,"More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: The causal link between air pollution and Covid-19 cases is yet to be established conclusively but long-term exposure will certainly make people more vulnerable to lung infections, warn scientists as the skies over large parts of north India, including Delhi, turn smoky and the air quality deteriorates rapidly.Their concerns come amid several global studies pointing to the possible connection between higher air pollution levels and increased Covid-19 cases and deaths.A study by researchers at Harvard University in the US in September showed that an increase of only one microgram per cubic metre in PM 2.5 is associated with an 8 per cent increase in the Covid-19 death rate.“Given the current limited literature, the surge of PM2.5 level in Delhi may be associated with increased Covid-19 cases ... Although the literature is relatively sparse at this stage,” Xiao Wu, corresponding author of the Harvard study, told PTI.He said the relationship between long-term air pollution and Covid-19 has been documented in many studies, which indicate that adverse health impacts of air pollution can make people prone to the infection or exacerbate the severity of Covid-19 symptoms once infected.This is interesting, especially considering Covid-19 causes viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and severe inflammation to the heart and circulatory system, the scientist said.Another study by the University of Cambridge in April found an association between living in an area of England with high levels of air pollution and the severity of Covid-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.“Based on our findings, I would expect to see an association between higher levels of air pollution in India and Covid-19 in the winter, similar with what we found in England,” said Marco Travaglio, corresponding author of the Cambridge study.“If the levels of air pollution have been consistently above the legal limits for several months or years before this coming winter, I would expect to see a relationship between those levels and Covid-19 burden across different parts of India in November and thereafter,” Travaglio told PTI.He noted that a key component of PM2.5 toxicity is its composition which may vary considerably between countries.“Nonetheless, the WHO legal limits for PM2.5 are currently set at 10 µg/m³ (microgrammes per cubic metre) annual mean. Levels beyond 500 µg/m³ are extremely high and may have considerable impact on people's health in relation to Covid-19 but also beyond it,” said Travalgo.The level of small particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in Delhi have averaged around 180-340 µg/m³ in the past few weeks while that of bigger pollution particles (PM10) has hovered between 120 and 450 during the time.Long-term exposure to chronically high PM2.5 levels weakens the ability of the lungs to fend off infections, therefore making people more susceptible to Covid-19, the scientists said.In addition, studies from Italy have shown that traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the genetic material of the virus, can be found on pollution particles, meaning that increased air pollution may act as a vehicle to increase Covid-19 transmission in highly polluted places.The air quality in north India is expected to deteriorate further from November to February due to several factors such as stubble burning, festive fireworks and low wind speed conditions which lead to an uptick in vehicular and industrial pollution being trapped in the lower atmosphere.""In view of this evidence, high levels of PM2.5 in Delhi may lead to a higher number of Covid-19 cases,” Travalgo added.Studies in humans have shown that toxic air particles can penetrate airways and cause widespread infiltration of lung cells.This chronic state of inflammation may induce or aggravate health conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, experts said.Because these conditions have been widely found to be associated with increased risk of contracting Covid-19 or incurring into critical illness, it is likely that air pollution acts as a risk factor to increase the susceptibility to Covid-19.India has the world's second-highest caseload of over 7.9 million and the third-highest death toll with more than 115,000 from the novel coronavirus The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned that Delhi is likely to report around 15,000 Covid-19 cases daily in winter because of the prevalence of respiratory illnesses during this season that worsen the symptoms of the disease. On Sunday, the national capital recorded 4,136 fresh Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in 38 days.D J Christopher, head of pulmonary medicine at the Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu, noted that the increased severe form of Covid-19 among patients would lead to an increased ICU hospitalisations, thereby increasing the burden of the healthcare system.“The lung is the gateway to the body and takes the first impact from inhaled pollutants. It causes an inflammatory response which damages the lung and makes it more susceptible to infections,” Christopher told PTI.'Let us hope the numbers are not so high. There is a chance of hospital beds getting filled and shortage of ICU beds,“ he added.Prof Rajneesh Bhardwaj concurred, saying there is growing scientific evidence that airborne respiratory droplets carrying the virus travel and contaminate the air after an infected person coughs. He added that pollution may help this airborne droplet to remain suspended for a longer time and may increase the spread of Covid-19.“PM2.5 are finer particles which remain suspended in the air for a long time and hence droplet or viral particles can cling on to these particles to increase the risk. They may increase the number of cases as pollution increases especially with large PM2.5 levels,"" Bhardwaj, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, told PTI.He said the government should make contingent plans to deal with an expected large number of cases and warned that any healthcare system can be overwhelmed by a larger number of cases.According to pulmonologist Anurag Agarwal, however, the relation between air pollution and Covid-19 cases is very complex. While in general high air pollution increases risk of respiratory infections, it is difficult to say much more, he said.“Studies finding more infections and deaths in areas with high pollution have tried to statistically adjust for higher population density in polluted cities. Such adjusted correlations are interesting but do not represent proof,” Agarwal, director of the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, told PTI.""Nevertheless, it is clear that air pollution is bad for health and Covid-19 is more dangerous in unhealthy people. So the message is clear - we must take steps to reduce air pollution for many reasons,” he added."

Pratap Sarangi: All citizens in the country to get free Covid-19 vaccine,,"BHUBANESWAR: Union minister Pratap Sarangi on Sunday said that all people of the country will be given free Covid vaccine , amid the demand by opposition parties in the country for it and not only in poll-bound Bihar as announced by the BJP.The BJP announcement of free Covid vaccine for Bihar, where assembly polls begin this week, had kicked up a controversy with the opposition parties tearing into the NDA government alleging that the ruling party was using the pandemic for political reasons.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the announcement was in order as it was an election manifesto announcement.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that all people will be provided free of cost vaccines. An estimated Rs 500 odd will be spent on vaccination of each person, Sarangi told reporters after addressing a campaign meeting for the November 3 assembly by-poll in Balasore.Modi had in a televised address to the nation on October 20 said that Indian scientists are in the process of developing several vaccines that are at different stages of clinical trials and the results seem encouraging.Sarangi, the union minister of state for animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries and micro, small and medium enterprises spoke in reply to question raised by Odisha Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister, R P Swain.Swain had earlier in the day sought clarification from Dharmendra Pradhan and Sarangi, the two union ministers from Odisha questioning them for their silence on their party BJP's stand on free Covid-19 vaccination for the people of the state along the lines of the one being promised in Bihar.The governments of Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Puduchchery have already announced free of cost Covid vaccines for the people of their states, while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has demanded free vaccine for all citizens across the country.Swain had tweeted ""I am asking questions to two Odisha union ministers from Balasore soil to clarify as to why the people of the state will not get free of cost Covid vaccine. The union ministers should clarify BJPs stand on the corona vaccination in Odisha.On the state governments steps for vaccination, Swain said it has signed an agreement with a vaccine manufacturer and is committed to extend the facility to all people of the state.He, however, did not say whether the state government will provide the vaccine to the people free of cost.BJP deputy leader in Odisha Assembly Bishnu Charan Sethi said the Centre has been supporting Odisha fully during the pandemic and has granted Rs 22,000 crore for the purpose.""But large scale lapses have been detected in the utilisation of the fund,"" he alleged."

Even brief interactions adding up to 15 minutes enough to infect: Study,,"MUMBAI: Underlining the need to use a face mask and maintain a six-foot distance from others, new research suggests the novel coronavirus-2019 could spread through brief interactions adding up to 15 minutes.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released evidence a few days ago to say a “close contact” is one who spent a cumulative 15 minutes or more within six feet of someone who was infectious over 24 hours, even if the time is not consecutive. Until now, CDC defined a close contact as a person who had spent 15 minutes or more within six feet of a positive patient Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government task force on Covid-19, said the new definition from the CDC points to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has become more contagious than before. “The infectivity is higher, but the criticality is not,” Joshi said.Viruses continue to mutate, and scientists across the world had a month ago indicated that successive mutations may have made it easier for the virus to spread.Dr Rahul Pandit , also a member of the state Covid-19 task force, said doctors in the country had highlighted the greater risk posed by multiple exposures. “The point is not about a patient sneezing or coughing, it is about the viral load. If the patient has high viral load, then transmission to the person standing close will be easier,” he said.He said it is possible to reduce the risk by wearing a mask or maintaining physical distance.Regarding the virus becoming more contagious, Pandit said experts from Europe, which is witnessing its second Covid wave, say that while cases are increasing rapidly, hospitalisations have not increased drastically.The country is seeing a dip in the Covid curve now but should wait for 15 to 21 days before it can relax. “We can be sure about the virus becoming less dangerous when the number of asymptomatic patients and those needing home isolation greatly outstrip the symptomatic ones needing hospitalisation,” a doctor said."
Devendra Fadnavis tests positive for Covid,,"MUMBAI: Former Maharashtra CM and now leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis (50) announced on Saturday that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and had self-isolated.Fadnavis was recently on a tour of rain-affected districts of the state and was also campaigning for the Bihar elections, as he was appointed in-charge by his party."

Covid-19: HC asks Delhi govt to ensure sero survey report not leaked to media,,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court Tuesday directed the AAP government to ensure that the report of the fourth sero surveillance, which is likely to conclude soon, shall not be leaked to the media till the matter is heard by it. The high court also expressed displeasure over delay in informing persons about their result of Covid-19 test , which should be conveyed in 24 hours.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad noted that one of the court staff got his test report after four days and said such things should not happen.The high court was informed by Delhi government counsel Satyakam that the fourth sero surveillance will conclude on October 22 and the report would come out after a fortnight.The counsel said one of their senior professors who will analyse the sero survey reports is suffering from Covid-19.The bench directed that the sero survey report be not leaked to the media before the next date of hearing on November 11.It also sought the stand of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on a new test called Feluda, which is being marketed by TATA sons and is pending approval from ICMR.The high court was hearing a PIL by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking increasing the Covid-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.The high court had earlier observed that the AAP government was ""frittering away"" a part of its RT-PCR testing whose numbers were ""abysmally low"" when compared to the rapid testing figures and had said it made no sense when the daily number of coronavirus positive cases were averaging around 3,500-4,000.RT/PCR, short for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a laboratory technique widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and to measure gene expression in research.The government had told the bench that the third of sero surveillance carried out by it in Delhi between September 1 to September 7 has found that seroprevalence of antibodies to Covid-19 in citizens of the national capital has reduced from nearly 29 per cent in August to 25 per cent in September.The bench on September 16, had asked the Delhi government to increase the RT-PCR test capacity to the maximum possible to detect Covid-19 infection, as RATs were only 60 per cent accurate."

Besides, pollution is an added factor,"" Medical Director, LNJP Hospital, Suresh Kumar, told .People with asthma, COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) and other respiratory ailments are more susceptible to suffer fall in their oxygen concentration level and thus more prone to contract the infection from someone else, symptomatic or asymptomatic, he said.According to doctors, respiratory illnesses like viral influenza increase with a spike in pollution levels as poor air quality leads to inflammation in the lungs making it more vulnerable for the virus to penetrate.""We would advise patients with respiratory illnesses to stay indoors as much as possible. Also, appeal to youth to not assume everything is normal again just because the economy is getting eased. Mask should be worn all the time while being outdoor and social distancing norms should be followed,"" said a senior doctor of a government hospital.On September 21, the number of home isolation cases had increased to 19,213 after steady ascent in its count since the last week of August.However, it fell by a margin of 749 on September 22 to 18,464, registering a significant fall after a long time.It fell further down to 17,834 the next day when the number of containment zones stood at 1,987.The containment zone count had crossed the 2,000-mark on September 24 (2,059) and the home isolation cases too had showed a marginal rise (17,995).

The plea also stated that the order is exposing non-Covid-19 patients to the risk of Covid-19.""Reserving 80 per cent ICU beds will deny urgent care to seriously ill patients, requiring vital surgical interventions and critical care.

"Coronavirus in Karnataka: Govt has spent Rs 42,00 crore on fight against Covid-19, says minister",,"A view of Karnataka assembly during the monsoon session

BENGALURU: The Karnataka government on Wednesday said it had spent no less than Rs 4,200 crore since March till August on its fight against Covid-19 pandemic.

Responding to a debate on government action in fighting the pandemic and misappropriation in medical equipment purchases at the legislative assembly, medical education minister K Sudhakar said Karnataka is still in the midst of the “war against Covid” and that there is a long way to go for achieving victory against the virus.

“While the opposition claims there is a Rs 2,300 crore misappropriation, I would like to place it on record that the total expenditure in this fight itself is Rs 4,200 crore. The amount has been spent by 15 departments of the state in their various capacities,” he said.

The minister said the maximum amount of expenditure has been used by the health and family welfare department with Rs 1,142 crore while his department, medical education, has spent Rs 76 crore till date.

The other big department expenditure is from the labour welfare board which has spent Rs 824 crore in direct benefit transfer (DBT) to 16.48 lakh.

Reiterating the government's stand that there was no misappropriation, Sudhakar claimed that there were four scrutiny committees which looked into every purchase of medical equipment, including the personal protection equipment (PPE) and ventilators.

“In the last six months we have tried to upgrade the medical health facilities and that is the reason we have spent on high quality products,” he said, while claiming the opposition allegations as misleading.

Citing the example of the Rs 18 lakh ventilator which was procured by the government, Sudhakar said only one such equipment was procured at that rate.

“Now, the opposition claims that neighbouring Tamil Nadu has purchased 100 ventilators at Rs 4.8 lakh each. These ventilators are transport or ambulance ventilators and cannot be used in ICUs. The Rs 18 lakh ventilator is of high definition quality and is used in the ICU by us,” he justified.

However, the minister could not respond to questions raised by opposition leader Siddaramaiah that all ventilators had the same functionality.

“As far as I understand, any ventilator, the basic function is to provide an artificial breathing facility for patients who cannot breathe independently. What does it matter whether it is Rs 4 lakh or Rs 18 lakh? Who are these people using the Rs 18 lakh ventilator?” he retorted.

However, the minister and Karnataka government stuck to its stand that there was no misappropriation and refused to commission a judicial probe into it.

Not happy with the response, the Congress and JD(S) legislators walked out of the assembly as a mark of protest.

Earlier, Sudhakar, justifying the reasons for the sudden spike of Covid-19 positive cases in the state over the last two months, claimed it was primarily due to the influx of people from outside the state.

“Every state in the country or in other nations have seen a spike of cases for two or three months on account of a sudden rush of migrants back home. Karnataka has also seen this after thousands of people came back home from mostly high risk states which surround the state,” he claimed.

The minister said after unlock phases began and people returned to normalcy, these numbers started to multiply and add to the spike.

"Wall Street tumbles as virus cases soar, stimulus hopes fade",,"(Representative image: AP)

NEW DELHI: US stocks decline picked pace on Monday afternoon, setting the Dow for its worst day in more than seven weeks, as soaring coronavirus cases and a political deadlock over the fiscal relief bill raised doubts about the fate of the economy recovery.

New infections have touched record levels in the United States, with El Paso in Texas asking citizens to stay at home for the next two weeks. In Europe, Italy and Spain imposed new restrictions.

Travel-related stocks, vulnerable to COVID-19 related curbs, dropped. The S&P 1500 airlines index fell 5% and cruise line operators Carnival Corp and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd shed more than 9.5% each.

""People are nervous about the expansion in cases,"" said Christopher C Grisanti, chief equity strategist, MAI Capital Management, Cleveland, Ohio.

""The administration has said it does not want to slow down the economy yet as cases rise they may not have a choice.""

Energy index tracked a more than 3% fall in oil prices. Other economically-sensitive industrials and financials sectors posted the steepest percentage declines among S&P sectors.

Meanwhile, chances of a fiscal stimulus before the presidential election faded as US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said there were a number of areas in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's plan that President Donald Trump cannot accept.

Wall Street's fear gauge hit a near seven-week high even as 60 million Americans voted in a record breaking early turnout as Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden enter their final week of campaigning.

It is also one of the busiest weeks of the third-quarter earnings season that will see results from mega-cap US tech firms including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc.

The tech sector, which includes Apple, is among the only three sectors apart from healthcare and consumer staples that is expected to post an increase in profit compared to a year earlier.

Of the 139 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, 83.5% of them have beaten Wall Street expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

At 12:30 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 767.14 points or 2.68% to 27,577.43, the S&P 500 lost 73.59 points or 2.11% to 3,392.13 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 201.99 points, or 1.75% to 11,347.51.

Software company Oracle Corp fell about 4% after German rival SAP abandoned medium-term profitability targets and warned of a longer than expected recovery time from the pandemic hit.

Hasbro Inc tumbled 10% as quarterly adjusted revenue fell due to coronavirus-led delays in the production of movies and TV shows.

Companies deemed stay-at-home winners including Amazon.com Inc, Zoom Video Communications Inc and video game companies Activision Blizzard Inc and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc rose between 2.2% and 0.3%.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 7.91-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 5.00-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded three new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 38 new lows.

Melbourne Lockdown News: Melbourne lockdown lifted after zero new virus cases recorded,,"MELBOURNE: Australia's second-biggest city will this week exit its coronavirus lockdown following nearly four months under onerous restrictions, authorities announced Monday, after no new daily cases or deaths were recorded.Stay-at-home orders for Melbourne's five million residents will be lifted from midnight Tuesday into Wednesday while restaurants, beauty salons and retail stores will be permitted to throw open their doors.Melbourne and the surrounding Victoria state recorded the first 24-hour period without any new Covid-19 cases since June 8 -- before security bungles at quarantine hotels housing returned international travellers sparked a major outbreak in July.Announcing the much-anticipated relaxing of restrictions, Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews ' voice cracked as he declared it an "" emotional day "".""This has been a very difficult year. And Victorians have given a lot and I'm proud of every single one of them,"" he told reporters in Melbourne.Asked if ale-loving Victorians could now ""get on the beers"", Andrews said he ""might go a little higher up the shelf"".Jubilant social media users declared the return to zero cases and deaths ""Donut Day"", with the hashtag trending as Twitter users posted selfies with the sweet treats in celebration.Melbourne in the summer became the epicentre of the country's second coronavirus wave, with new daily cases rising above 700 in August when the rest of Australia was already rolling back restrictions.Some curbs were already lifted last week, allowing haircuts and golf games to return, but further easing planned for Sunday was delayed by 24 hours to assess thousands of test results after a small outbreak in the city's north.Andrews said all the tests had returned negative.""It was worth waiting to be absolutely confident to be sure that our team had their arms around those positive cases and fundamental control of the outbreak -- and that is exactly what these numbers show us,"" he said.Pressure had been mounting for weeks on state authorities to allow the city more freedoms, with a litany of rules remaining in place as they took a cautious approach to reopening despite the falling number of cases.The rest of Victoria state is already enjoying fewer restrictions, with gyms set to reopen and outdoor live music to resume from Tuesday.Restrictions on travel between Melbourne and regional Victoria will be lifted from November 8, with a 25-kilometre (15-mile) travel radius for city residents also set to be removed the same day.The state remains cut off from the rest of Australia, where regional authorities have largely taken a hyper-vigilant response to Covid-19 such as maintaining internal border restrictions.Those measures have attracted criticism from some quarters.On Sunday, conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison took a partisan swipe at Andrews' centre-left government, claiming Victoria's restrictions had caused ""1,000 job losses per day"".Overall, Australia has been relatively successful in containing the spread of the coronavirus, with about 27,500 cases and 905 deaths in a population of 25 million.The country also maintains strict controls on its international borders to prevent transmission of the virus from overseas, which has left tens of thousands of its own citizens stranded abroad.Authorities now hope to remove internal travel restrictions, bring more Australians home from overseas, and create ""travel bubbles"" with other countries that have curbed the virus -- all while continuing to maintain low case numbers."

'Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trials produce robust immune response in elderly'

LONDON: Staff at a major London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc , The Sun newspaper reported on Monday.The Sun said the hospital was told to prepare for the vaccine from the ""week commencing the 2 November.""A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, hammered the global economy and shuttered normal life across the world.The Oxford vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate.Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine was developed by Oxford University scientists and licensed to AstraZeneca in April, which took on the task of scaling trials and production.The British drugmaker has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial.The vaccine is likely to provide protection for about a year, CEO Pascal Soriot said in June.The Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc produces a robust immune response in elderly people, the Financial Times said on Monday, citing early results.The Oxford vaccine triggers protective antibodies and T-cells in older age groups, the FT said, citing two people familiar with the finding.Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the newspaper reported.Oxford and AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, the FT said.

Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the Financial Times reported earlier.Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, the FT said.

Dinner off as Italy closes restaurants early in virus crackdown,,"AP photo.

ROME: Italy 's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte tightened nationwide coronavirus restrictions Sunday after the country registered a record number of new cases, despite opposition from regional heads and street protests.

Cinemas, theatres, gyms and swimming pools must all close under the new rules, which come into force on Monday and run until November 24. Restaurants and bars will stop serving at 6:00 pm, Conte's office said.

Italy, which was the first European country to be hit hard by the pandemic and impose a nationwide lockdown , on Saturday registered nearly 20,000 new cases over 24 hours.

""The aim is clear: to keep the contagion curve under control, because that is the only way can we manage the pandemic without being overwhelmed by it,"" Conte told a press conference.

It was imperative Italy act now to avoid a second full lockdown, which ""the country can no longer afford"", he said.

Schools and nurseries will remain open, although up to 75 percent of classes for high-schools and universities will move online. People have been urged to avoid using public transport or moving beyond their own communities.

""This is going to destroy us,"" Augusto D'Alfonsi, who owns the Torricella family-run fish restaurant in Rome , told AFP.

""We've already lost 50 percent of our customers this year. Without government aid, we're done for.""

The new measures were introduced just hours after dozens of far-right protesters in Rome clashed with riot police during a demonstration against the region's curfew, setting off fireworks, burning bins and throwing projectiles.

Some 200 masked militants belonging to the neo-fascist group Forza Nuova lead the skirmish in a second night of street protests, after hundreds of demonstrators clashed with officers in Naples further south over the curfew there.

Several regions have imposed overnight curfews in a bid to slow-rising Covid-19 infection numbers. Piedmont in the north and Sicily in the south will follow this week.

But regional leaders had warned that closing businesses would exacerbate social tensions as the country struggles to emerge from its worst post-war recession, sparked by the two-month shudown earlier this year.

Giuseppe Spadafora, deputy president of business lobby Unimpresa, said the ""anger could explode in the coming days and weeks, becoming difficult to control"".

Conte, however, has been under intense pressure from scientists to do more to curb contagion.

""It is a complex moment, there's a lot of tiredness in the country,"" he acknowleged Sunday.

""The pandemic is severly challenging us, it provokes anger, frustration. It's also create new inequalities, on top of the existing ones,"" he said.

Conte said he too ""would feel angry over government measures"" as an ordinary citizen, though ""I would wait to see the economic support, which will be substantial"".

He also warned against ""giving room to those who specialise in protests and social disorder"", after the far-right demonstration in Rome and reports the Naples protest was orchestrated by organised crime.

The World Health Organization's Italian government adviser Walter Ricciardi told the Messaggero daily the country was ""paying the consequences"" of regional governments failing to prepare for a second wave.

""We only have a few weeks to intervene. We need local, even regional lockdowns. The curfew does not work"".

Italy has now registered over 500,000 cases and more than 37,000 deaths, according to health ministry figures.

Over 100 scientists urged the government to act this week after physicist Giorgio Parisi said that without new measures there would be 500 covid deaths a day in Italy by November, at the speed the virus is spreading.

""In March we were about to be hit by a lorry going 130 kilometres an hour. Today it's travelling towards us at 60 kilometres an hour,"" he told the Repubblica newspaper on Saturday.

""We have time to dodge it but if we don't, even if it's travelling more slowly, it will kill us all the same"".

US Covid-19 cases soar as Pence's staff at White House test positive,,"A new coronavirus outbreak at the White House involving Vice President Mike Pence 's staff comes as the United States reported a near-record number of new cases on Saturday.The United States reported 79,852 new infections on Saturday, close to the previous day's record of 84,244 new cases. Hospitalizations are also rising and have hit a two-month high and deaths are also trending upwards, according to a Reuters tally.Late on Saturday a spokesman for Pence said Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, had tested positive for the new coronavirus. Pence and his wife tested negative earlier in the day and the vice president will not alter his schedule as he campaigns ahead of the Nov. 3 election, the spokesman said.Mark Meadows, White House chief of staff, told CNN on Sunday that Pence was an essential worker and did not need to quarantine as recommended by guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some of Pence's aides also tested positive, Meadows said.The latest outbreak follows what health experts described as a super-spreader event at the White House on Sept. 26 where President Donald Trump announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.So far in October, 29 states have set records for increases in new cases, including five states considered key in the presidential election: Ohio, Michigan North Carolina , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin Hospitals are strained in several states including North Dakota , which is the hardest hit based on recent new cases per capita, according to a Reuters analysis."

Spraying disinfectants on streets can be 'harmful': WHO,,"May 17, 2020, 01:15PM IST

The WHO has said that spraying disinfectants on the streets to fight the novel coronavirus disease could be harmful as it does not eliminate the virus. The health body has warned that spraying disinfectants outdoors even poses a health risk. Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces, such as streets or marketplaces, is not recommended to kill the Covid-19 virus or other pathogens because disinfectant is inactivated by dirt and debris, the WHO has warned. It says that the chemical spraying is also unlikely to cover all surfaces for the duration of required contact time needed to inactivate pathogens. WHO has also said that spraying individuals with disinfectants is not recommended under any circumstances"

"Donald Trump: I am immune to Covid-19, says Trump",,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday declared himself immune from Covid-19 as he prepares to return to the campaign trail in a fight to regain ground against surging White House rival Joe Biden.""It looks like I'm immune for, I don't know, maybe a long time and maybe a short time, it could be a lifetime, nobody really knows, but I'm immune,"" Trump said in a Fox News interview, a day after his doctor affirmed he wasno longer a transmission risk for the disease.""You have a president who is immune... so now you have a president who doesn't have to hide in a basement like his opponent,"" he added -- in a jab at the Democrat Biden and his far more cautious approach to campaigning in a pandemic.It is not yet clear to what degree contracting Covid-19 confers immunity from future infection, with early studies suggesting a few months while newer ones have indicated it could last longer.While it acknowledges that -- generally -- a person who recovers from a viral infection is protected against new infection, the World Health Organization cautioned in August: ""For COVID-19, we do not yet have enough data to confirm if antibodies protect, what antibody levels are required, or how long protection will last.""During his phone interview on Fox News, Trump went on to suggest that his White House rival could himself be sick.""If you look at Joe, he was coughing yesterday horribly and grabbing his mask, as he's coughing,"" Trump said. ""And I don't know what that was all about, and it didn't get much press.""The Biden campaign has been publishing daily coronavirus tests for their candidate since Trump tested positive on October 1 -- landing him in hospital for three nights and derailing his campaign.There has been less transparency surrounding Trump's own state of health, with his medical team repeatedly refusing to say when he lasted tested negative for the virus. That has fueled suspicions that he may not have been tested for several days prior to his diagnosis.Trump rallied hundreds of supporters for a comeback event at the White House on Saturday, and is planning back-to-back rallies this week in a bit to salvage his struggling campaign three weeks from the November 3 election."
India's first coronavirus vaccine: Here is everything we know about its development,,"The whole world is waiting eagerly for an effective vaccine to fight the coronavirus pandemic. It has not only claimed lives, but also impacted people, both physically and mentally. There are more than 170 vaccines in progress right now, but closer home we have our hopes pinned on India’s first vaccine called Covaxin.Under normal circumstances, researchers and scientists take years before formulating and releasing a vaccine, however, the global impact of COVID on humankind has pressed a ‘forward’ button on all vaccines, where it is safe to expect a vaccine in the next 4-5 months (within a span of 12-18 months).Covaxin, the vaccine candidate developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is in Phase 2 clinical trial in the country. And now the makers have sought approval from drug regulators to start the third phase clinical trial. As per reports, the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) has asked Bharat Biotech to submit ""complete safety and immunogenicity data of the phase II trial"" and some clarifications before proceeding for the next stage.The results of their animal-based trial of the vaccine were found to be favourable. ""The vaccine candidate was found to generate robust immune responses. Thus, preventing infection and disease in the primates upon high amounts of exposure to live SARS-CoV-2 virus.""The vaccine candidate has been tested in 12 hospitals across India, where volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 participated in the trial. These volunteers had no co-morbidities. The places where the trial took place include Hyderabad, Delhi, Goa, Rohtak, Patna, Kancheepuram and Bhubaneswar, among other places.Covaxin falls under the category of inactivated vaccines. For the unversed, this means that the virus pathogen is ‘deactivated’ to disable it from causing infection, however, some parts of the virus can be identified by the immune system, leading to an immune reaction.Bharat Biotech took a strain of isolated coronavirus from the National Institute of Virology, Pune to develop the inactivated vaccine at its Hyderabad facility, Genome Valley.The previous week, the firm shared that Covaxin will make use of ViroVax’s adjuvant Alhydroxiquim-II to boost immune response in the body and provide longer lasting immunity. ""There is critical need for development and availability of adjuvants that elucidate mechanisms of action inducing greater antibody responses to vaccine antigens, thus resulting in long-term protection against pathogens. Adjuvants also enhance the sustainability of the global vaccine supply on account of their antigen-sparing effect,"" shared Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech.As per official statement from Bharat Biotech, once the vaccine is injected into a human, it has no potential to infect or replicate, since it is a killed virus. It just serves the immune system as a dead virus and mounts an antibody response towards the virus.To kickstart the phase 3 trial, Bharat Biotech will be enrolling 28,500 volunteers who will be older than 18 years. The trial will be carried out in 10 Indian states including Mumbai, Delhi, Patna and Lucknow.As per reports from PTI, a dose of 0.5 ml on day 0 and 28 will be the administered dose for volunteers.Once the trials are done, Bharat Biotech will be targeting a manufacturing capacity of 300 million doses.India is the largest vaccine producing country in the world and if India is able to produce an indigenous vaccine, it will help in fighting the capacity and managing the delivery capacity.ICMR has said that the vaccine candidate will follow all global norms to produce the most effective vaccine, which may take sometime."

"Excessive use of hand sanitisers may boost antimicrobial resistance, warns experts",,"NEW DELHI: Increased usage of antibiotics during Covid-19 can lead to more antimicrobial resistance, health experts of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences said, adding that the widespread use of hand-sanitisers and antimicrobial soaps can further worsen the situation.Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of a pathogenic microbe to develop a resistance to the effects of an antimicrobial medication. It has been estimated that by 2050, about 10 million human lives could be at risk every year if drug resistance is not managed.Various aspects of antimicrobial resistance were discussed in a two-day international webinar on antibiotic resistance jointly organised by All India Institute of Medical Sciences and American Society for Microbiology.The webinar was organised by Dr Rama Chaudhry, Professor and Head of AIIMS 's Department of Microbiology, International Ambassador of American Society for Microbiology to India and her team Dr Bimal Kumar Das, Dr Sarita Mohapatra, Dr Gagandeep Singh, Dr Hitender Gautam and Dr Nishant Verma.In the webinar, the health experts talked about how the Covid-19 pandemic has jolted the entire world and significantly impacted the focus of health facilities towards antimicrobial resistance.""It has been estimated that as we reach the year 2050, about 10 million human lives could be at risk every year if we do not manage the increasing drug resistance. The widespread use of hand sanitisers and antimicrobial soaps which has especially increased multifold during the Covid-19 pandemic can worsen the situation,"" the experts said.They went on to say that antibiotic-resistant organisms have become rigidly established in our environment with many infections failing to respond to currently available antimicrobials. The antimicrobial resistance has outpaced the development of newer antimicrobials.The health experts added that there is an urgent need to explore the alternative therapies. ""The importance of these non-conventional and alternative therapeutic approaches like bacteriophages, endolysins, nanoparticles, probiotics and antimicrobial peptides are needed.""Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine. It mounts problems beyond the geographical as well as species barriers and can transmit from animals to humans.The webinar was inaugurated by the Guest of Honour and AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria, and Chief Guest Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, Director of National Centre for Disease Control. It also covered a vast range of topics from esteemed speakers from Centre for Disease Control, World Health Organisation Indian Council of Medical Research , PGIMER Chandigarh, and IIT Roorkee.Various aspects of antimicrobial resistance were discussed including surveillance, one health approach, role of whole genome sequencing, including alternative therapies.

Kerala as well as Karnataka recorded their highest peak in daily cases even as the number of infections in all other states, barring Bengal, was lower than their respective peaks. Kerala recorded 10,606 fresh cases, a huge jump of over 1,300 cases from the previous peak on October 2 when 9,258 patients had tested positive.

India sees 88 rape cases a day; conviction rate below 30%,,"Shocking numbers

Uttar Pradesh holds the worst record

Rajasthan tops in rape cases

No effect of Nirbhaya judgment

NEW DELHI: On September 14 this year, a 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly gangraped in Uttar Pradesh ’s Hathras by four upper-caste men. The incident caused widespread outrage and brought the focus on just how pervasive sexual violence against women is in our country. The woman sustained several injuries and died nearly 14 days later. To make matters worse, the police cremated her in the dead of night without the knowledge and consent of the family.The Supreme Court termed the incident ‘horrible and shocking’ while hearing a plea for probe by the CBI and SIT into the alleged gangrape on Tuesday.However, this isn’t the lone incident that has shaken up the country. Several incidences like Nirbhaya rape case (2012), Unnao rape case (2017), Kathaua rape case (2018) and the Hyderabad rape cum murder case (2019) expose the grim reality of bestial sexual crimes against women in the country. A survey by Thomas Reuters Foundation in 2018 ranked India as the most dangerous country for women.Crimes against women have been steadily rising over the years. According to the latest NCRB report, 2019 saw over 4 lakh reported cases of crimes committed against women, up from 3.78 lakh in 2018 and 3.59 lakh cases in 2017.NCRB reported 32,033 rape cases which translates to a shocking 88 rape cases a day -- and this is just 10% of all crimes against women. Experts say that picture could be far worse as most such crimes go unreported in the country.NCRB data shows that in 2019, Uttar Pradesh topped the states in crimes against women with a whopping 59,853 cases, followed by Rajasthan and Maharashtra with 41,550 and 37,144 cases respectively.In terms of rape incidences, Rajasthan fared worst with nearly 6,000 reported cases. Uttar Pradesh ranked second with over 3,000 cases.The recent incident proves that the execution of the convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case (that took place this year) had no effect on criminals. When the execution took place, it was assumed that it would send a strong message to perpetrators of such crimes, but the recent incidents have proved it otherwise.One reason for this is poor conviction rate and the long road to justice. In 2018 and 2019, the conviction rate for rape was below 30%. Which means out of 100 cases only 30 saw convictions. Absence of forensic labs, fast-track courts and investigators are also partly responsible for this."
"Airline Ticket Refund: After SC order, DGCA issues detailed refund rules",,"Category 1

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation on Wednesday issued detailed guidelines for refund of fares for flights cancelled during Covid-19 lockdown after the Supreme Court recently decided on the issue. The regulator, based on SC directives, has categorised refund seekers into three categories and issued different directives for them.- Passenger who booked tickets during lockdown for travel during lockdown from 25 March 25,2020, to May 24: If an airline has received payment from such a passenger for either domestic or international travel, it “shall refund the full amount collected without any cancellation charges … within three weeks from the date of cancellation,” the DGCA order says.If tickets have been booked through a travel agent, “full refund shall be given by airlines immediately to the respective travel agent (who in turn) shall immediately pass on (the same) to passengers.”Airlines, both Indian and foreign, will need to refund full fares to category 1 passengers who booked ex-India tickets for international travel.- Passengers who booked tickets any time prior to lockdown for journey up to May 24, 2020, and flight cancelled due Covid-19: “Airlines shall make all endeavours to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days from October 7, 2020. If on account of financial distress, any airline/airlines are not able to do so, they shall provide credit shell, equal to the amount of fare collected, in the name of passenger when the booking is done either directly by the passenger or through travel agent so as to consume (utilise) the same on or before March 31, 2021,… on any route of (their) choice or the passenger can transfer the credit shell to any person including the travel agent through whom he / she has booked the ticket and the airlines shall honour such a transfer,” the order says.The credit shell issued in the name of the passenger shall be transferable and used for travel up to March 31, 2021. “In cases where tickets are booked through agent, credit shell as issued in the name of the passenger which is not utilised by March 31, 2021, refund of the fare collected shall be made to the same account from which account amount was received by the airline,” it adds.Based on SC directives, the DGCA has asked airlines to incentivise all those issued credit shells. “…compensate the passenger from the date of cancellation up to June 30, 2020, in which event the credit shell shall be enhanced by 0.5% of the face value (the amount of fare collected) for every month or part thereof between the date of cancellation and June 30, 2020. Thereafter the value of the credit shell shall be enhanced by 0.75% of the face value per month up to March 31, 2021,” it says.Category 2 passengers who have booked ticket for international travel on a foreign carrier and the booking is ex-India, “then the airline shall make full refund to the passenger”.- Passengers who booked ticket anytime for journey after May, 24, 2020: Normal refund rules as per applicable civil aviation requirements (rules) of DGCA will apply to category 3 passengers whether domestic or ex-India International.“All stakeholders are instructed to ensure strict compliance of the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the above judgement,” says the order issued to all schedule Indian and foreign airlines operating to and from India, by the DGCA on Wednesday."
"CDC revises guidance, says COVID-19 can spread through virus lingering in air",,"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday said COVID-19 can spread through virus lingering in the air, sometimes for hours, acknowledging concerns widely voiced by public health experts about airborne transmission of the virus.The CDC guidance comes weeks after the agency published - and then took down - a similar warning, sparking debate over how the virus spreads.In Monday's guidance, CDC said there was evidence that people with COVID-19 possibly infected others who were more than 6 feet away, within enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.Under such circumstances, CDC said scientists believe the amount of infectious smaller droplet and particles, or aerosols, produced by the people with COVID-19 become concentrated enough to spread the virus.The CDC has long warned of transmission through small droplets that shoot through the air and generally fall to the ground, which resulted in the six-feet social distancing rule. Aerosol droplets are much smaller still, and can remain suspended in the air, like smoke.While CDC stresses close-contact transmission is more common than through air, a group of U.S. scientists warned in an unrelated open letter published in medical journal Science on Monday that aerosols lingering in the air could be a major source of COVID-19 transmission.

Its test positivity rate (TPR) during the period was also high at 13.8%, much above the national average of 7.3%. Only Maharashtra has a higher TPR in the country -- 16.7%.Health experts said Kerala's Covid peak is expected in two weeks and the key question is whether the state's health infrastructure is ready to handle more patients. The answer is not that encouraging.""There are ICUs and ventilators ready in districts to treat Covid patients but there is no adequate trained manpower. There is excess pressure on the existing facilities due to this. Once we reach our peak, it will be catastrophic and we will see more deaths,"" a health department official said. Incidentally, the expert committee headed by Dr B Ekbal and even the chief secretary has been asking the health department to train doctors and nurses to handle the critical care units but nothing much has moved on the ground.There is also a manpower crisis, with health workers in conflict with the government. ""The recent incidents at Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital , the cancellation of seven days' off for those involved in Covid duty and salary cut with extra duty are definitely demotivating for healthcare workers. We have been working tirelessly and frustration is growing now,"" said Dr Joseph Chacko, president, Kerala Government Medical Officers' Association. ""The Covid infrastructure needs to be strengthened and made accessible to the general public. Silent hypoxia (drop in oxygen levels) is a main problem in Covid and people suddenly feel ill. At that moment, they should know which hospital to go to in their districts,"" said Dr Shenoy Padmanabha who has been analysing the Covid pattern across the country."

A precinct is a voting district in a town, city or county. Each precinct has a single polling place where voters cast ballots. Some precincts might contain thousands of voters, while others may have only a handful. In some states, tracking the percent of precincts reporting on election night is a reliable way to estimate how much of the vote has been tallied across the state. But as more people vote before Election Day, either in-person or by mail, reporting by precinct has become less reliable as a measure of the progress of the vote count in many states. That's because counties in some states don't include these advanced votes when reporting precinct results. Instead, they released the results of advance votes separately."

Ever since he returned from the UAE with an abdominal muscle tear and checked in at the NCA earlier this month, Sharma has been under the care of the support staff at the academy, where a thorough clinical assessment was carried out. The NCA is learnt to have informed the BCCI recently that Sharma will need time until November 18 to fully recover, following which the 32-year-old bowler will require another three to four weeks' time to train before he is drafted into the side for an international game. The NCA has also ""recommended"" that the bowler be allowed to play a warm-up game or two before he is drafted into the playing eleven for a Test match. Meanwhile, wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant is also learnt to be struggling with 'weight issues', following which the call has been left for the selectors to take if he can travel with the team. What's rather important to note here is that the Indian team won't be looking at calling any replacements from India once they fly to Australia - thanks to Covid protocols."

Kishore Biyani’s deal to sell off Future Group assets to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries for Rs 24,713 crore is now on hold. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) has granted an interim relief in the issue to the Jeff Bezosled Amazon, for now, two people aware of the matter said. Earlier this month, Amazon had approached SIAC over its dispute with Future Coupons, one of the holding companies of Biyani’s Future Group, where Amazon had invested Rs 1,431 crore, citing breach of terms due to its sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries. This was preceded with a legal notice from Amazon to Future Group. While an interim order puts the merger on hold, the matter will continue to be heard at SIAC before the sole arbitrator, former attorney general of Singapore, comes to a decision. Legal experts said, typically, it’s the party dissatisfied with the international arbitration order that takes the matter to Indian courts, but Amazon might have to approach the Indian courts too, depending on the final order. “This was an emergency arbitration hearing, where they (Amazon) sought an interim stay on the merger so that the Future-Reliance deal doesn’t close formally, while the matter is in international arbitration,” a person aware of the development said. The development comes even as Reliance Industries has applied for a clearance with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on its deal with Future Group. Sources aware of the matter said the arbitration proceedings could go on for several weeks before a final order comes. This could also have an impact on banks that have lent to Biyani’s Future Group as the lenders are reportedly worried over their loans turning into non-performing assets (NPAs) owing to arbitration proceedings delaying the merger. “We welcome the award of the emergency arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought. We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process,” a spokesperson of Amazon said on Sunday. A Future Group spokesperson declined to comment on the matter."

A report on the prospects of growth in the media and entertainment industry by Pricewaterhouse-Coopers said Indian entertainment and media segments will grow at 10.1% and would be worth $55 billion by 2024. The PwC Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2020-2024 predicted a K-shaped bifurcated recovery for the sector in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and said the upward curve would be led by strong growth in OTT platforms, internet advertising, videos, games and e-sports segment, music and podcasts. It also said digital revenue, globally, was expected to contribute 60% to the total entertainment and media revenues by 2020. “OTT video in India is expected to see the largest gain and reach 5.2% by 2024, closely followed by internet advertising,” the report said, adding that while India would remain the world’s biggest cinema market in admission terms, cinema revenue in the country will contract at -2.6% to $1.5 billion over the next five years. “The pandemic has accelerated ongoing shifts in consumers’ behaviour, pulling forward digital disruption and reaching industry tipping points that wouldn’t otherwise have been reached in the next few years. Our research shows that India will be the fastest growing entertainment and media market globally in terms of pure consumer revenue,” Rajib Basu, partner and leader, entertainment and media, PwC India, said. The PwC outlook also said companies must build and maintain direct-to-consumer relationships, offer enough differentiation or scale to compete, and unlock greater value using the right technologies. In the post-pandemic world, India holds the most potential of any market in the world in the OTT video segment and its rate of growth is expected to see total OTT video revenue overtake South Korea, Germany and Australia to jump to being the sixth-largest market in 2024, the report said."

Paytm said it aims to support one million apps on its recently launched Android Mini App Store as part of its efforts to support Indian developers and compete against tech giant Google. The company will also invest Rs 10 crore for the app developers on its platform. Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma - who has been vociferously voicing his concerns around the 'monopolistic' behaviour of the US-based company - said with its steep 30 per cent fee, Google has started to play the role of a 'toll collector' instead of enabling the ecosystem. He added that the company is committed to developing India's technology ecosystem. Paytm had said over 300 app-based service providers have already joined the programme. These apps are expected to make their way to the Mini App Store soon. Paytm had announced the launch of its Android Mini App Store earlier this week, just weeks after Paytm's app was blocked from Google Play Store for a few hours for violating the Google's policy on sports betting activities. Mini apps are a custom-built mobile website that gives users app-like experience without having to download them. This would help users with limited data and phone memory."

Samsung Pop Out Smartphone: Samsung may be working on a smartphone with pop-out display,,"After foldable phones, Samsung may be gearing up to launch phones with a new design that includes a flexible display that pops out. Samsung has reportedly filed a patent for a smartphone that comes with a flexible display that comes out of its chassis slightly. So, what’s the purpose of this? Samsung wants to put a loudspeaker resonance chamber within the tiny among of space created inside the body after the display pops out a bit, as per a report by LetsGoDigital .

“The telephone housing consists of a front and a rear panel, between which all components are placed. One or more speakers are placed directly under the front panel, as well as a microphone, a front camera module and various sensors.”

The idea is to make room for better speakers. The report claims that Samsung and LG have been looking at including better quality speakers to improve audio quality of their phones . The display will be made on plastic polymer, similar to the ones seen in Samsung’s foldable phones like the Galaxy Z Flip or Z Fold 2.

“These components can move with the front panel and flexible screen. The top part of the screen makes an inward folding movement, without the housing moving with it. This creates extra resonance space for the sound equipment within the housing,” said LetsGoDigital .

Samsung has not made anything official about this technology yet. While Samsung may or may not be working on a smartphone like this, there is no official word about it either.

Meanwhile, HTC may have plans for a foldable phone , if we go by a recent patent filing. Spotted by LetsGoDigital, the patent filing shows a smartphone with hinge in the middle. It seems like the fold would be horizontally in the middle.

Qualcomm: Qualcomm partners with audio firm for hearing enhancement software,,"Qualcomm Technologies International has collaborated with Jacoti , an audio technology company, to bring Jacoti’s hearing enhancement software to the Qualcomm QCC5100 Series Ultra-Low Power Bluetooth SoCs. Available for true wireless earbuds and Bluetooth headsets, this integration, the companies believe, will add accurate personalised hearing assistance with additional safety features.

As per Jacoti, its technology comes with a self-administered hearing test that prompts various tones and frequencies, to establish volume thresholds for the user’s level of hearing. Two audiograms are then created, tailored specifically to the user’s right and left ears, acting as the user’s individual hearing prescription based on their level of individual hearing.

These audiograms, in conjunction with the Jacoti technology, will work on devices featuring the Qualcomm QCC5100 Series SoCs and across multiple devices, with the software claimed to intercept the incoming sound before it reaches the user’s ears and then adjusting the volume of the appropriate frequencies to compensate for the user’s individual hearing deficiencies. The software on the device is also claimed to prevent the user from exposure to sounds that can cause further hearing damage.

“By working with Jacoti, we’re making hearing enhancement and personalization technology more accessible to consumers than ever before. For our customers, who are competing in a rapidly changing and crowded market, exciting technologies like this will provide a really interesting way to differentiate and enrich the end user experience, ” said James Chapman, vice president and general manager, Voice, Music & Wearables, Qualcomm Technologies International, Ltd.

Microsoft’s latest Xbox gaming consoles are now official and are set to go on sale starting November 10 globally. But it seems that the company has another inexpensive gaming device in production. Xbox head Phil Spencer has hinted towards new hardware for gamers which is mainly focused on Xbox xCloud game streaming service.

According to the hint, the new device is expected to be an Xbox xCloud streaming stick device like Amazon Fire TV Stick or other media-centric devices that directly plug into the HDMI port of the television and draws power from the USB port.

In a conversation with Stratechery (via The Verge), Spencer mentioned that these kinds of hardware can take the form of a streaming stick, or any other portable form factor and they will also be relatively cheaper compared to the upcoming Xbox Series S and Series X gaming consoles. Spencer also indicated the inclusion of Xbox Game Pass subscription with these devices to allow users stream and play their favourite titles on their TV.

Microsoft has not confirmed any other details about the streaming device such as name, features, requirements and pricing. The company was earlier rumoured to launch a game streaming stick back in 2016 and was expected to cost around $99. We may get to see the cheaper Xbox hardware next year.

For those unaware, Sony is also expected to expand its PS Now gaming subscription service to more countries including India soon. The new service allows users to streaming their PlayStation games on compatible devices and also brings several other benefits.

"Apple may launch new entry-level AirPods, AirPods Pro in 2021",,"Rumours suggest that Apple may launch two new models of AirPods in 2021

Unless there’s a surprise up its sleeve, it looks like Apple is more or less done with the 2020 launches. Rumours about a MacBook launch are doing the rounds but that remains to be seen. With 2020 launches almost out of the way, the rumour mills have starting churning about what 2021 might have in store. A report by Bloomberg suggests that Apple may launch a new entry-level AirPods and an upgraded AirPods Pro next year.

As per the report, the upcoming entry-level AirPods could feature. Design which is similar to the current AirPods Pro. This could mean a shorter stem and replaceable ear tips could be a part of the new AirPods. The report also says that Apple is rumoured to be working on improving the battery life of the AirPods. Also, as per Bloomberg, the entry-level AirPods will just have the design element of the AirPods Pro. In terms of features like noise-cancellation, they might not make their way to the entry-level AirPods.

As far as the second-gen AirPods Pro are concerned, the Bloomberg report states that Apple is looking at a design overhaul. The short stem that is currently there in the AirPods Pro could be totally removed. The report says that a design is being tested and it has a more rounded shape. Something like what we have already seen in wireless earbuds from the likes of Samsung and Google.

The report also mentions that features like noise-cancellation, wireless antennas could prove challenging to fit in a smaller case for the AirPods Pro. In other words, nothing has been finalised yet as far as the AirPods Pro’s next model is concerned. Having said that, leaks and rumours posted by Bloomberg have proven to be more ore less accurate in the past.

Google has removed three popular apps aimed for kids from Google Play Store for violating the company’s data collection policies .

TechCrunch has reported that Princess Salon, Number Coloring and Cats & Cosplay apps have been removed from Play Store after International Digital Accountability Council (IDAC), a nonprofit organisation based out of Boston highlighted that these three apps were found collecting Android ID and Android Advertising ID (AAID) and hence violating Google’s data collection policies.

According to the report, these apps were not directly associated with data collection. Reportedly the issue was with the frameworks -- Unity, Appodeal and Umeng that were powering the apps. The frameworks were collecting the Android ID and AAID from the kids’ phone and that’s a direct violation of Google’s policies.

In response to the issue, Google clearly stated that it takes action against any app that violates policy and in this case, Princess Salon, Number Coloring and Cats & Cosplay apps have broken the policy of not using developer kits that aren’t approved for ‘child-directed services’.

"Samsung: Samsung and Stanford researchers develop 10,000 PPI OLED display",,"Researchers from Stanford University and Samsung have managed to create a 10,000PPI OLED display , as per a Stanford blog post. The new display architecture is reportedly better than modern displays when it comes to PPI. Modern day smartphones have got a PPI (pixel-per-inch) range that hasn’t even reached 1,000PPI.

The display could arrive on future TVs, smartphones and VR/AR devices. As per the blog post, such high resolution displays would be especially beneficial for the VR/AR devices with their screens inches away from our eyes. The more the pixel density, the more compactly they are packed per inch, which is said to lead to more life-like, sharp and realistic images. The 10,000PPI display is also claimed to be brighter and have more colour accuracy than the current displays.

As per the blog post: “The advance is based on research by Stanford University materials scientist Mark Brongersma in collaboration with the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT).

“We’ve taken advantage of the fact that, on the nanoscale, light can flow around objects like water. The field of nanoscale photonics keeps bringing new surprises and now we’re starting to impact real technologies. Our designs worked really well for solar cells and now we have a chance to impact next generation displays.”, the post quotes Brongersma.

Samsung’s next step is going to begin working at full-sized 10,000PPI displays, notes the blog post.

Game pass vs PS Plus: How Microsoft Xbox Game Pass compares with Sony PS Plus,,"Xbox

Game Pass vs PS Plus

: Pricing

Xbox Game Pass vs PS Plus: Benefits

Xbox Game Pass vs PS Plus: Verdict

Buying a gaming console has moved beyond just the games and pricing. Both Microsoft and Sony have already started moving towards the subscription-based online streaming model like OTT platforms for movies and TV shows that brings several benefits to the users on behalf of a fixed monthly or yearly fee. These benefits include access to the latest titles, free games and more.Microsoft Xbox comes with Xbox Game Pass, while Sony PlayStation has its own PS Plus subscription-based service. Although both the services are meant for the same purpose, their execution is opposite. Let’s put them side-by-side and see which one offers more benefits and is better value-for-money.Pricing is among the most important factors here and Xbox Game Pass certainly feels ahead of the PS Plus. The Game Pass service can be topped over the monthly Xbox Live Gold subscription by paying just Rs 489 per month for console and PC. The Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs Rs 699 per month that also includes Xbox Gold Live membership and offers all the benefits of it to the users. The Ultimate Game Pass also works on PC.Sony PS Plus subscription costs Rs 499 per month, Rs 1,199 for 3 months and a yearly subscription will cost Rs 2,999.Monthly pricing for both the subscription services cost around Rs 500 and are neck-to-neck.The argument over offering a better selection of games between the two consoles is a never-ending battle and perhaps almost impossible to answer. So, let’s say it depends upon the user. Xbox Game Pass and PS Benefits are totally different from each other, but both have their pros and cons.The PS Plus subscription is more focused on offering quality benefits rather than quantity, while Xbox Game Pass focuses more on quantity. Sony offers two free premium titles for free every month to PS Plus subscribers and they can play the game as long as they have an active PS Plus membership. For example, this month Need for Speed Payback and Vampyr are the two free games for PS Plus subscribers. In addition to that, PS Plus subscription also offers online multiplayer gameplay.Xbox Game Pass, on the other hand, offers access to over 100 high-quality console and PC games which players can play as much as they want. Microsoft-exclusive titles arrive on Game Pass the day of its launch and players can play the game without any additional cost. In addition to this, the entire collection gets shuffled time-to-time. Some popular titles include Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, The Witcher 3, GTA V, Doom Eternal, Forza Motorsports, Batman Arkam Knight and more.The major difference between the two services is the execution. PS Plus games get added to the users' collection forever. While on Xbox, users can only play the game till the time it is a part of Game Pass collection. It is more likely that you might have to say goodbye to the title you love to play eventually.Few things are common between both the subscriptions such as exclusive discounts on select games, add-ons, pre-orders and more. However, Xbox Game Pass has a slight edge here as it offers Xbox Live Gold subscription depending upon the tier. Starting November 10, the Game Pass Ultimate will also include EA Play subscription at no additional cost. This will give users access to hundreds of EA Game titles as well.There’s no clear cut winner here as both services are very different when it comes to benefits, so everything depends upon the use case scenario. If you are someone who loves to build a huge library of quality games and love playing online multiplayer titles, PS Plus subscription is the one for you. However, if you love trying new titles especially from EA and Microsoft-exclusives then Xbox Game Pass makes more sense here. Xbox Game Pass also works for PCs running Windows 10 operating system and ever updating libraries and more extensive titles does give it a slight edge over PS Plus."
Three important numbers that prove Google is 'everywhere' in your life,,"Google is omnipresent in the lives of those who use smartphones, laptops or tablets. There’s no getting ‘away’ from the Sundar Pichai-led company. Be it search, Maps, Gmail, internet browsing — it’s mainly all about Google, Google and Google. Still, sometimes you need numbers to prove how dependent people are on Google or how the company is literally everywhere in your life.Let’s start with Search. Google is so dominant that ‘Google’ it has become a part of the lexicon. There are, of course, other search engines. DuckDuckGo for the ‘hipsters’ and those who value privacy. There’s Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia whereas Bing and Yahoo are amongst the ‘popular’ search engines. Google, however, towers above them all. As per StatCounter, a database of global stats related to search, browsing and others, Google Search had a whopping 92.2% market share in September 2020. Bing had 2.8% share, Yahoo had 1.5% while Baidu, DuckDuckGo and Yandex rounded off the top 5.Now, let’s take a look at the browser market share where Google’s offering is the widely popular Chrome. Compared to Search, Google isn’t that dominant but a clear leader by some distance. Chrome , as per StatCounter, had a market share of 66% in September 2020. Apple ’s Safari browser came second with around 16% market share followed by Mozilla Firefox. Samsung Internet, Microsoft Edge and Opera complete the top 5 browsers in the world.Moving on, Search and Chrome are primarily used on smartphones and here too Google is the dominant player, thanks to Android . StatCounter pegs Android’s market share at close to 74%. This means almost three in every four smartphone users have an Android-based phone. Apple’s iOS had close to 24% market share while Samsung and others have minuscule share in the OS market.Browsing, search and mobile OS — three areas where Google is a dominant player and hence literally everywhere in people’s lives."

Different modes and campaigns are expected to be its USP. However, there may not be a battle royale mode in FAU-G to begin with. The developers are expected to add it later. As for the availability, reports suggest that the game may come to Google Play and App Store in November."
12-year old threatened with jail for missing Zoom class: Report,,"The report quotes Mark Mastrov, the father of the boy, as saying that he received a letter from the school pri... Read More

A 12-year old student of Stanley Middle School, San Francisco, California was allegedly threatened with jail term after he skipped three Zoom class sessions of 30 minutes each on a single day, as per a report by The Mercury News.

The report quotes Mark Mastrov, the father of the boy, as saying that he received a letter from the school principal in which his son was threatened with consequences, including jail time.

The father also reportedly added that his is not the only such case; other parents in the district have received similar letters.

“Out of the blue, we got this letter. It said my son had missed classes, and at the bottom it referenced a state law which said truants can go to jail for missing 90 minutes of class. I called the school and said, ‘Hey, I want to clear this up."", the report quotes Mastrov.

As per the father, his son does not miss his classes, ever and it may be the case that he got a bit late and logged on after the roll call was taken.

According to Betsy Balmat, the principal of the school, if a student is absent from class, the school will make up to three automatic calls to the parent or guardian.

“If we have not heard back after three of those, we send a letter,” the principal adds.

California does have a new law that enables school districts to take action against students who miss their classes.

As per the state education code, a student is considered truant if he/she is absent from school ""without a valid excuse three full days in a single school year, if consistently tardy or if absent for more than a 30-minute period during the school day without a valid excuse on three occasions in a single school year.""

Penalty for such truancy includes make-up classes, paying fines and even jail time.

The father of the 12-year old, however, reportedly denies having got any calls before the letter arrived.

China has ‘good news’ for Apple despite tensions with US,,"

The latest iPhone 12 models seem to be an instant hit in China with people queuing up outside Apple ’s flagship store in Beijing to buy. Despite tensions between China and the US, sentiments of Chinese consumers are not much affected by Donald Trump ’s anti-China stance.

As a report by the South China Morning Post , “compared with last year’s iPhone 11 line of phones, the iPhone 12 line is showing strong demand in China.” The report further stated that this increased demand for 5G enabled iPhones despite “stiff competition “is a testament to the continuing power Apple has to draw in Chinese consumers even as tensions with the US have intensified.” China is one of the biggest markets for iPhones globally. TF Securities International analyst Kuo Ming-Chi estimates that China will account for up to 40% of global demand for the iPhone 12 Pro.

The new iPhone 12 costs more in China than the US due to local taxes and tariffs. Despite higher prices, people in China are even spending more to be among the first ones to get their hands on the new iPhones. In fact, on the first day of the sale, some people were even reselling brand new iPhones at up to 1000 yuan (around Rs 11,000) more to buyers who were waiting in the queue in front of the Apple store.

One of the reasons for the demand in China could be the new compact size of the iPhone 12 Mini. The South China Morning Post quoting a buyer said, “Android phones are often too big. The iPhone 12 is a tribute to the classic iPhone 5s and is much lighter and thinner, and the user experience is also way better than on Android phones.”

This is interesting as people are paying almost double the price of 5G-enabled Android phones from Oppo, Xiaomi , Huawei and Chinese players for size and experience.

How Google paid ‘tribute’ to Pele on his 80th birthday,,"Football legend Pele turned 80 this October 23. To commemorate his birthday, Google added a special easter egg to the bottom of the search page when someone searched for “Pelé” or “Pele.” The “Goooooooooogle” that’s seen at the bottom of the search results was replaced with “Gooooooooooal” in an alternating green/yellow pattern, the colours of the national football team of Brazil .If you observe the photo minutely, the link that would take you page 10 of the search results was marked as “#10”, the number of Pele’s jersey during his Santos FC and the New York Cosmos days. The “o” just about the #10 was replaced with a football and when you click the number, an animation of the letter “a” kicking the football to the “G” starts. “G” kicks the ball into the goal (wrapped around letter “I”), in a nod to Pele’s bicycle kick, after which the G and all the o’s erupt in jubilation, hinting at them representing players. If you count the letters from G to o, excluding the a and the I, it comes out to be 11, which most probably signifies a football eleven.The easter egg stayed on the search results on October 24 also and it is not yet known when it would be replaced with the usual “Goooooooooogle” seen at the bottom of every search result."
"What you will pay for iPhone 12, 12 Pro in these countries",,"Apple’s iPhone 12 series has been quite the talk of tech town since their launch just over 10 days back. The one thing — a perennial talking point with iPhones — which is unsurprisingly on most people’s minds is the pricing. The iPhone 12 Pro range, at least in India, starts at Rs 1.19 lakh whereas the iPhone 12 (not the mini) is close to Rs 80,000. Apple has to pay customs and taxes in India which does make the iPhone expensive than most other countries. Buying an iPhone from other countries — if possible — has always been a cheaper option.To put the simple conversion rule and you will see that the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are perhaps the most expensive in India when compared to most other popular smartphone markets. For instance, the iPhone 12 (128GB variant) in the US starts at $879. If you add taxes then it will cost close $940, which converted to Indian rupee would be roughly Rs 70,000. The iPhone 12 in India starts at Rs 79,900 for the 64GB variant. The 128GB variant costs Rs 84,900.The same goes for countries like China, Japan, UK, Russia — where the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are cheaper than what they cost in India. The government of India had hiked the GST rate from 12% to 18% which made the iPhone costlier. Not only that, but import duties on certain components were also hiked, which led to iPhones costing more.Having said that, Apple’s iPhones now are available across the price range for those looking for premium phones costing above Rs 40,000. From the iPhone SE to iPhone 12 Pro Max, Apple now has an iPhone from as ‘low’ as Rs 40,000 to as high as Rs 1.3 lakh."

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is the world’s richest man with an estimated net worth of $190 billion. During the early days of Amazon, Bezos had introduced a ‘two-pizzas’ rule and now a report by Business Insider reveals that it is something Paytm too applies in the organisation.

The two-pizza rule was simple: internal teams in organisations should be small enough so that they can be with just two pizzas. The idea is to improve efficiency and scalability. It is something that Paytm does as well, according to its chief technology officer (CTO). As per the Business Insider report, Dhody said about the two-pizza rule that “in my mind is the most efficient organisational designs for structuring teams.”

Paytm generally, as per the report, has 6-8 members in a team. Dhody further said that small team are more efficient in asserting ownerships over particular domains. The two-pizza rule at Paytm means that teams are “single owners of that domain. Nobody else in the organisation owns that domain,” Dhody was quoted as saying in the Business Insider report.

Bezos had applied the two-pizza rule initially for meetings and making them more productive. The more number of people in a meeting is likely to stretch for longer hours and hence reduce efficiency of people. The Amazon CEO, in fact, once reportedly said that during the entire year, he spends just six hours meeting with the big investors of Amazon.

As per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos’ estimated net worth stands at $189 billion and in 2020 it has grown by as much as $74.1 billion.

India ranks 131 in global mobile internet speeds: Here’s why unlimited mobile data is of little help,,"India’s ranks 131 in mobile data speeds; Lags behind Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka

How much mobile internet data do you actually need daily?

Here is how much mobile internet data is consumed on average on an hourly basis:

Activity Data consumption Playing Call of Duty Mobile for 1 hour 35MB Watching YouTube videos at 360p resolution for 1 hour 280MB Watching YouTube videos at 720p resolution for 1 hour 600MB Watching Facebook videos for an hour 300MB Watching a movie on low resolution on Netflix (1.35 hours) 650MB Google Chrome (2 hours) up to 150MB

Why are better speeds more important than unlimited data?

Mobile users in India have mostly forgotten to keep a check as to how much data they are spending, thanks to cheap unlimited data plans . In fact, India has the cheapest mobile internet plans in the world. Getting 2GB of 4G data per day by spending less than $5 a month is standard in the country. You can even get 3GB data per day if you decide to spend just $1 more monthly.Super affordable mobile internet is one of the key highlights in the digital journey of India. While you may struggle to finish 2GB or 3GB mobile internet data on a daily basis there is no denying that you still need to connect to a reliable Wi-Fi connection while playing games or watching high-resolution videos. This is because there may be ample mobile data but the speed is limited.If you use any tool to check the speed of your mobile internet data plan then you will be surprised to see the high ‘claimed’ speed. But just play one video on YouTube in 720p or 1080p then the reality of this ‘claimed’ high speed mobile internet becomes clear. This is the common story for all telcos in India in general. In some locations, you may get good speeds while in others you may struggle to even refresh your Facebook page. And most users have given up on complaining to customer support as the standard bot reply is of little.The fact that more data is not equivalent to a better speed is even highlighted by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index. As per September 2020, India ranks 131 out of 138 in the global mobile internet speed rankings. While the global average download speed is 35.26 Mbps (megabit per second), India lags at just 12.07 Mbps. The global average upload speed and latency is 11.22 Mbps and 42 ms, India lags at 4.31 Mbps and a higher latency of 52 ms.South Korea topped the list with an average mobile internet speed of 121.00 Mbps. This is double the average fixed broadband speed in India, which lags at 46.47 Mbps, as per Speedtest Global Index-- September 2020 data.Neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal rank higher than India in the global in the index. While Sri Lanka ranks 102nd with a speed of 19.95Mbps, Pakistan is at 116th spot with 17.13 Mbps. Nepal occupies 117th spot with a speed of 17.12Mbps.While unlimited data is highly welcome, you may not need so much especially if you are relying on your home Wi-Fi for online classes, gaming and watching videos.Content creators are already posting 4K videos on YouTube but if you hit the play button, in all probability and at most places, it may take forever to load. Also, for telcos to lure users to spend more on data, they will have to improve speeds. The maths is simple. If you are able to smoothly play a 4K video on your phone then your 2GB data will be exhausted in an hour. This may make you buy more data, thus helping telcos boost average revenue, commonly called ARPU. Also, people will get the option to choose between watching 360p and 4K videos if they know their mobile internet speeds will be able to support it."

Why Apple may have reasons to be cautiously optimistic in India,,"In a year where life — and plans — have been disrupted like never before, Apple has had a rather unusually busy year. More so, 2020 could very well be the year when Apple took rather big strides in its India story. From March to October, Apple has launched a slew of new products across its range. Be it Watch, iPad, MacBook, HomePod, and finally the iPhones — Apple has launched a new product in each of those categories. In India, it also opened its Online Store to allow it to reach out to more consumers.A report by Canalys suggests that Apple recorded double-digit growth as far as iPhones are concerned. The report pegs Apple to have sold nearly 800,000 units of the iPhones in Q3 of 202o. “Apple is finally paying attention to India,” said Canalys Research Director, Rushabh Doshi. “It has opened a direct online store, giving it several new angles in its go-to-market strategy, such as utilising device trade-ins to provide purchase incentives, or bundling AirPods with iPhones to make them more appealing.”The impact of the direct online store wouldn’t have been felt in Q3 2020 as Apple opened the store on September 23. It’s too early to gauge how well or how big an impact the online store has in India. Though early signs suggest that it could work very well. The first online offer — bundling of free AirPods on purchase of iPhone 11 — was allegedly sold out within hours of offering.The key for Apple’s growth in India could very well be directly linked to how the iPhones sell. Other markets may have embraced other Apple devices but India perhaps remains an iPhone-centric region. For that Apple has now an offering in almost every price bracket above Rs 40,000, which gives the Cupertino-based company a shot at every kind of buyer looking for a premium smartphone.Though it has to be said that the iPhone 12 series — especially the Pro devices — could prove a rather hard sell in the country. As Doshi of Canalys puts it, “The new iPhone 12 family will be a tough sell in India this year, as network operators do not yet have the infrastructure for mass market 5G deployment, erasing a key feature of the devices.” It’s not just 5G but the pricing of the iPhone 12 Pro is highly prohibitive. Starting at Rs 1.19 lakh, the iPhone 12 Pro series is the most expensive iPhone launched in India and one of the most expensive smartphones available. Doshi says that not just 5G but “Apple’s pricing strategy for its new iPhones in India needs serious consideration.”Beyond the iPhone 12, Apple has a lot of reasons to be cautiously optimistic about its India story. The launch of online store, the MacBook and iPad could also help it look beyond the iPhone. More importantly, it’s the pricing ‘older’ models — iPhone 11 and iPhone XR — alongside the new iPhone SE that could make the iPhone reach into more Indians’ pockets than ever before."

Financial health impacts well-being feel most Indians: Scripbox survey,,"Financial and physical health have been among the top two stressors for Indians amid Covid-19 ahead of relationships and family, as per findings of Scripbox ’s survey on ‘Wealth & well-being’. ""At a time when economic anxiety is increasing, an overwhelming 90 percent Indians identify financial health as having a profound impact on their well-being. Having a financial plan in place and investing in wealth creation emerge as ways to help alleviate financial stress and build a greater sense of personal well-being today,"" adds the survey.

The survey claims to understand investor behaviour and sentiment amid Covid-19. Conducted ahead of World Savings Day (celebrated globally on October 31), it aims to create awareness on the importance of saving and investing.

Amid Covid-19, Indians have been most stressed because of their physical health (54 percent), followed by financial health (46 percent), family (28 percent) and relationships (23 percent). While it’s popularly understood that money can’t buy happiness, an overwhelming 90 percent of Indians agree that financial health has a profound impact on their well-being. Respondents polled for this survey cite that having a financial plan in place (42 percent) and investing in wealth creation (23 percent) would lend significantly to their optimism about the future and their sense of well-being.

As for the savings, as per the survey, nearly 50 percent save 0 to 20 percent, and 20 percent save between 20 to 30 percent of their income. Majority prefer fixed income products such as PPF , LIC and other tax saving schemes, fixed and recurring deposits, or just letting it lie in their savings accounts. One in four respondents invest in Mutual Funds .

Compared to women, men view investments such as MFs and Shares and Stocks more favourably. Among men, 2 in 3 continued to stay invested in equity markets during the pandemic, whereas less than 1 in 3 women respondents continued to do so.

Interestingly, millennials (those under 35 years of age) are far more likely to let their savings lie idle in their bank accounts than those over 35 years, who would rather invest it than let money lie idle, indicating maturity of understanding of financial planning.

In the backdrop of the pandemic, emergency fund creation tops the goal that 54 percent respondents want to save/ invest for, followed by children's education (46 percent) and retirement (43 percent). While creating an emergency fund is a priority for both men and women, a higher percentage of men, 47 percent, would like to prioritise investing for retirement, while a majority of women, 55 percent, for their children’s education. Despite the intent to do so, saving for retirement is not taking priority right now, sidelined by other financial goals. 56 percent say that they do not actively invest to set up a retirement corpus.

Given the correlation between wealth and well-being, nearly 50 percent of respondents would like to advise their younger selves to start investing as early as possible in life.

Amazon Alexa Hindi: Amazon Alexa to soon get support for Hindi language,,"NEW DELHI: The e-commerce major Amazon introduced uts virtual voice assistant Alexa along with the Echo devices in India in 2017. Since its launch, the company has been rolling out updates which added India specific features and skills to it.

Amazon has now revealed another important feature which it will be bringing to its virtual assistant. The company said that it is bringing support for regional languages capabilities in Alexa for the Indian market. The regional language support will bring also add support for Hindi language.

The company said that the support for Hindi language in Alexa is in early stages of progress. The company claims that making Alexa speak Hindi is an easy process but the real challenge is to make Alexa understand the different accents and the form of language that is spoken in a particular region. Alexa has to be equipped to understand this and then react accordingly.

Moreover, Amazon wants to make Alexa more natural and conversational with humans with the help on machine learning. Presently, Alexa can understand some Hinglish commands. Amazon is also planning to introduce a feature using which users will be able to respond to Alexa's English statements in different languages such as Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, Kannada, Gujarati, Telugu and other regional languages.

Talking about the new development, Rohit Prasad, VP, and head scientist for Alexa said, ""Yes, we are working on infusing regional languages capabilities in Alexa for the Indian market but these are early days. For us, it is a contextual, cultural as well as content-related challenge as the question is not that Alexa just needs to understand Hindi. This part we can do relatively easily but Alexa needs to be Indian when it speaks in Hindi as there are several dialects and accents out there which Alexa has to understand and react accordingly.""

Google assistant: Here's how Google is 'assisting' in making this trend popular in Android phones,,"If you take a look at more than handful smartphones launched so far in 2019, they all seem to have one thing i... Read More

Let’s be clear on one thing that just with its Pixel devices, Google would’ve never been able to compete with Apple’s voice assistant Siri. So how does Google make its own voice assistant – Google Assistant – more popular? Simple: piggyback ride on the backs of other smartphone makers. If you take a look at more than handful smartphones launched so far in 2019, they all seem to have one thing in common: a dedicated button for Google Assistant.

In fact, at the Mobile World Congress 2019 , Nokia’s two smartphones – Nokia 3.2 and Nokia 4.2 – both have dedicated buttons for Google Assistant. It has also been spotted on two LG smartphones as well. However, LG had a dedicated Google Assistant button last year as well in its G7 and V40 smartphones. This year’s LG devices – the G8 ThinQ – also have the same button.

That’s not all. According to a report by 9to5Google, Xiaomi ’s Mi Mix 3 5G and Mi 9 are also expected to have a separate button for the Google Assistant. The report also suggests that Google is looking to reach over 100 million devices with its dedicated Google Assistant button. Even in the Vivo V15 Pro, we have seen the same button.

Meanwhile it’s been a busy day at the Mobile World Congress. Huawei showcased the world’s first 5G foldable phone whereas Nokia has been busy launching as many as five new devices. These five new devices include the Nokia 9 PureView (world’s first phone to feature 5 rear cameras), Nokia 1 Plus, Nokia 4.2 and Nokia 3.2. As we mentioned earlier, the budget smartphones from Nokia – 3.2 and 4.2 – feature the Google Assistant button. It’s clear that one of the most common trend of 2019 will be a separate button to fire the Google Assistant. Let’s see if other smartphone makers also follow suit in making Google reach its ambitious 100 million device mark.

Apple iOS: Apple continues to be way ahead of Google in this numbers game,,"When it comes to the latest OS update on its devices, Apple beats Google handsomely

When it comes to market share in the smartphone market, Apple ’s fortunes might be fluctuating but it still stays miles ahead of competition when it comes to one particular thing: adoption of the latest version of its operating system. So much so that now 4 out 5 iOS devices have the latest version (iOS 12). According to the numbers released on Apple’s Developer webpage, “as measured by the App Store on February 24, 2019, 80% of all devices are using iOS 12.”

Compare this to adoption of Google’s latest Android variant and Apple’s rival’s numbers are embarrassingly low. While the latest Android adoption numbers haven’t been made public by Google, a couple of months back when iOS was at 60%, Android Pie had mere 0.1% of adoption rate. The numbers must have grown at the turn of the year but since Google hasn’t released them we can’t be sure of the exact figure. What we can be sure of is that it won’t be anywhere close to the numbers Apple just posted.

Apple’s iOS 12, on the other hand, has seen its numbers grow handsomely in the last few months. In December 2018, iOS 12 adoption was 70% which grew to 75% in January and it’s now at 80%. Even when compared to last year’s OS update (iOS 11), iOS 12 seems to be clocking better adoption numbers. In January 2018, iOS 11 was adopted by 65% Apple users which is comparatively less than iOS 12.

Speaking of OS versions, it is expected that both Apple and Google will give a glimpse into their next versions sometime in May and June. Google is set to hold its I/O 2019 developer conference in May and has already confirmed dates. Apple, on the other hand, will hold its annual WWDC conference in June. The dates for those are yet to be confirmed by the Cupertino-based tech behemoth.

Oxford Covid 19 Vaccine: UK hospital told to prepare for Oxford Covid vaccine in November; Report,,"More on Covid-19

'Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trials produce robust immune response in elderly'

LONDON: Staff at a major London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc , The Sun newspaper reported on Monday.The Sun said the hospital was told to prepare for the vaccine from the ""week commencing the 2 November.""A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, hammered the global economy and shuttered normal life across the world.The Oxford vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate.Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine was developed by Oxford University scientists and licensed to AstraZeneca in April, which took on the task of scaling trials and production.The British drugmaker has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial.The vaccine is likely to provide protection for about a year, CEO Pascal Soriot said in June.The Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc produces a robust immune response in elderly people, the Financial Times said on Monday, citing early results.The Oxford vaccine triggers protective antibodies and T-cells in older age groups, the FT said, citing two people familiar with the finding.Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the newspaper reported.Oxford and AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, the FT said. It did not name the publication.The FT cautioned that positive immunogenicity tests do not guarantee the vaccine will ultimately prove safe and effective in older people."
"US Presidential Election 2020: False info, conspiracy theories target Florida's Hispanic voters",,"MIAMI: Less than two weeks before the US presidential election, conspiracy theories, racist posts and disinformation are targeting Hispanic voters in Florida, a key constituency in the battleground state.

A purported election fraud concocted by Democrats, an alleged plot among Jewish, Black and LGBTQ people to interfere in the election: these are some of the stories that have spread among voters in the United States, and among Florida Latinos in particular.

Take influencer Liliana Rodriguez Morillo, a Donald Trump supporter who is the daughter of singer Jose Luis ""El Puma"" Rodriguez. The Miami-based Venezuelan shared an image to her 485,000 Instagram followers of fake driver's licenses confiscated in Chicago.

""All registered to vote Democrat!"" she wrote in Spanish. ""Will there be fraud November 3? Are we playing dumb? Vote in person!""

There is no evidence that the licenses were linked to the Democratic party or to voter fraud. And US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) spokesman Steven Bansbach told AFP that CBP could only confirm that 19,888 driver's licenses -- mainly from China and Hong Kong -- were confiscated.

Lizette Escobedo, director of civic engagement at the NALEO Educational Fund, a non-profit that promotes political participation of Latinos, said that mistrust in the electoral system is common among Florida Hispanics in both parties.

The problem, she explained, is that ""many Latinos don't actually trust the electoral process. They're afraid that their votes are not going to count.""

The organization seeks to counter this perception at the national level with voter education campaigns.

""Florida is our largest digital ad buy budget that we have for this election,"" Escobedo said.

She said that Latinos are particularly vulnerable to disinformation because they define their positions in the American political system ""based on the political systems that they have in their home country.""

Latin America has a long history of authoritarian regimes from both the left and right, often sustained by elections flagged as fraudulent.

Last month, US representatives Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Joaquin Castro asked the FBI to investigate the spike in disinformation directed at Latinos in South Florida and to ""consider efforts of foreign actors to spread disinformation"" in this regard.

Many of these conspiracy theories favor Trump, who is head-to-head with Democrat Joe Biden in Florida, a crucial state in the November 3 election.

Hispanics in Florida make up 17 percent of a 14 million voter electorate.

Biden, the Jewish community, and African Americans have been the subject of disinformation.

Venezuelan radio host Carines Moncada of Actualidad Radio, a mainstream Spanish-language outlet in Miami, recently associated the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement with witchcraft.

According to the public radio WLRN, Moncada told listeners that Black Lives Matter practices ""'lo negro' -- witchcraft and devil worship -- and wants to burn down your property and kill police officers."" She then added that a vote for Biden ""supports that rape and anarchy.""

On her Facebook, Moncada reposted and translated an article from News Punch, an outlet known for disinformation, which claimed a co-founder of BLM practices witchcraft because activist Patrisse Cullors said in an interview that her movement was ""spiritual.""

""These kinds of barbarisms are said constantly,"" Roberto R. Tejera, a journalist and host on the same station as Moncada, told the Sun Sentinel. ""It's sort of the daily bread of Spanish radio.""

In another instance in September, local newspaper El Nuevo Herald -- the Spanish version of the Miami Herald -- had to remove the weekly Libre insert aimed at Cubans in Florida after a reader protested its anti-Semitic and racist content.

A Cuban columnist had written in the insert that the police protests were ""racial prostitution"" and that Jewish Americans were ""cowards"" for supporting BLM.

Another columnist, also Cuban, spoke of LGBTQ people in derogatory terms and denounced a supposed ""gay lobby"" backed by international communism.

Miami's Radio Caracol 1260 also had to apologize in August after state senator Annette Taddeo called out a paid segment in which the announcer predicted ""a dictatorship of Jews and Blacks"" if Biden won the presidency.

""This disgusting message, spread by Trump supporters, went out today on Miami @Carasol1260,"" Taddeo tweeted.

She added: ""Everyone -- regardless of party affiliation -- is obligated to repudiate and condemn this pro-Nazi and racist discourse.""

China Coronavirus Cases: China reports surge in symptomless Covid-19 infections,,"SHANGHAI: China reported the highest number of asymptomatic Covid-19 cases in nearly seven months, following a mass infection of an unknown origin in the northwestern Xinjiang region.Xinjiang health authorities found 137 asymptomatic cases on Sunday amid a testing drive for the 4.75 million people in the Kashgar area triggered by an asymptomatic infection in a 17-year-old female garment factory worker reported on Saturday. It was not clear how she was infected, though all of the new cases were linked to the garment factory.The woman's case was discovered during routine testing but it was not clear why she was subject to such testing, Chinese media reported quoting health officials.Contact tracing work to locate the origin of the outbreak is ongoing, the reports said.A total of 20 new confirmed and 161 new asymptomatic cases were reported in the mainland on Oct. 25, China's National Health Commission said in a statement.The number of new symptomless infections was the highest since China began publishing daily counts starting from those reported on March 31.More than 2.84 million people in the Kashgar area had already been tested for Covid-19 as of Sunday afternoon and the rest expect to be completed by Tuesday. The scale and speed of the testing is in line with those seen during other outbreaks including the most recent one in Qingdao earlier this month.Though the number of new Covid-19 cases are down sharply in mainland China from the peaks seen in February, Beijing is wary of another wave of infections and maintains mass and rapid testing capabilities.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China to date now stands at 85,810, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634."
"60,000 in Southern California to evacuate after blaze grows",,"Smoke and flames from the Silverado fire threatens areas near Irvine, California on Monday, October 26, 2020 ... Read More

LOS ANGELES: A fast-moving wildfire has forced evacuations for 60,000 people in Southern California as powerful winds across the state prompted power to be cut to hundreds of thousands to prevent utility equipment from sparking new blazes.

The smoky fire in Orange County broke out just before 7am on Monday and quickly threatened neighbourhoods in Irvine, a sprawling city of about 280,000 people.

California is extremely dry and fire danger is high as the state experiences winds that are gusting above 60 mph (97 kph) in places. Such winds can knock down power lines and send tree branches into wires, sparking fires.

It's not clear what started the Orange County fire.

"
Big power shutoffs in California as winds boost fire danger,,"Traffic moves steadily on the Bay Bridge as the Bay Area braces for possible high winds as seen from Grizzly P... Read More

SAN FRANCISCO: Large swaths of California had no electricity on Monday as utilities tried to prevent the chance of their equipment sparking wildfires while the fire-weary state was buffeted by powerful winds and dangerously dry weather conditions.

About 300,000 power customers — estimated at more than 1 million people — were in the dark as officials issued warnings for what could be the strongest winds for California this year.

North of San Francisco , a Mount St Helena weather station recorded a hurricane-force gust of 89 mph (143 kph) late Sunday and sustained winds of 76 mph (122 kph).

Winds had calmed slightly by Monday morning but still topped 60 mph (97 kph), the National Weather Service said.

“While this is less than what we saw earlier, these winds are still strong and dry conditions prevail,” the agency said on Twitter.

Winds reached 50 mph (80 kph) early Monday at lower elevations across the San Francisco Bay Area , where tens of thousands had their electricity turned off. Officials extended a red flag extreme fire danger warning through 5 pm on Tuesday for the region's eastern and northern mountainous areas.

A second round of strong gusts is predicted to sweep through the same areas on Monday night, forecasters warned.

Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable. October and November are traditionally the worst months for fires, but already this year 8,600 wildfires in the state have scorched a record 6,400 square miles (16,600 square kilometres) and destroyed about 9,200 homes, businesses and other buildings. There have been 31 deaths.

The electricity shutdowns marked the fifth time this year that Pacific Gas & Electric, the nation's largest utility, has cut power to customers to reduce the risk of downed or fouled power lines or other equipment could ignite blazes during bone-dry weather conditions and gusty winds.

On Sunday, the utility shut off power to 225,000 customers in Northern California and later did so for another 136,000 customers in 36 counties.

“This event is by far the largest we've experienced this year, the most extreme weather,” said Aaron Johnson , the utility's vice president of wildfire safety and public engagement. “We're trying to find ways to make the events less difficult.” Firefighting crews quickly contained small fires that broke out Sunday in Sonoma and Shasta counties. The causes were under investigation.

The National Weather Service predicted winds in Southern California of up to 35 mph (56 kph) in lower elevations and more than 70 mph (113 kph) in mountainous areas. Officials were worried that any spark could turn into flames sweeping through tinder-dry brush and forestland.

The conditions could equal those during devastating fires in California's wine country in 2017 and last year's Kincade Fire that devastated Sonoma County north of San Francisco last October, the National Weather Service said. Fire officials said PG&E transmission lines sparked that fire, which destroyed hundreds of homes and caused nearly 100,000 people to flee.

Weather conditions shifted in Northern California on Sunday, with humidity dropping and winds picking up speed, said Scott Strenfel, PG&E's senior meteorologist. He said another round of winds is expected Monday night.

Extreme fire danger moved into Southern California late Sunday following cooler temperatures and patchy drizzle over the weekend.

The Southern California Edison utility said it was considering preventative safety power outages for 71,000 customers in six counties starting Monday, with San Bernardino County to the east of Los Angeles potentially the most affected.

Los Angeles County officials urged residents to sign up for emergency evacuation notices and to be prepared to stay with family or friends in less risky areas. Local fire officials boosted staffing as a precaution.

“The reality is come midnight and through Tuesday we're going to be in the most significant red flag conditions we've had this year,” said Kevin McGowan, director of the county's Office of Emergency Management.

Many of this year's devastating fires were started by thousands of dry lightning strikes, but some remain under investigation for potential electrical causes. While the biggest fires in California have been fully or significantly contained, more than 5,000 firefighters remain committed to 20 blazes, state fire officials said.

PG&E officials said the planned outages are a safety measure and understood they burden residents, especially with many people working from home and their children taking classes online because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Sheriff Kory Honea of Butte County in Northern California said he's concerned about residents in foothill communities during the blackouts because cellular service can be spotty and it's the only way many stay informed when the power is out.

“It is quite a strain on them to have to go through these over and over and over again,” he said.

China retaliates against news media in latest feud with US,,"BEIJING: China has ordered six US-based news media to file detailed information about their operations in China the latest volley in a month-long battle with the Trump administration.

A foreign ministry statement issued late Monday demanded that the bureaus of ABC, The Los Angeles Times, Minnesota Public Radio, the Bureau of National Affairs, Newsweek and Feature Story News declare information about their staff, finances, operations and real estate in China within seven days.

The announcement came five days after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said six Chinese media would have to register as foreign missions, which requires them to file similar information with the U.S. government.

The six were the third group of Chinese media required to do so this year. Each time, China has responded by forcing a similar number of US media to file about their operations.

The ministry statement said China was compelled to take the step ""in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States .''

Pompeo, in making his announcement, said the targeted Chinese media are state-owned or controlled, and that the U.S. wants to ensure that ""consumers of information can differentiate between news written by a free press and propaganda distributed by the Chinese Communist Party.''

The media is one of several areas of growing tension between the two countries as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on China over trade, technology, defense and human rights.

The US ordered the closing of the Chinese consulate in Houston earlier this year, and China responded by shuttering the US consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu .

"Muslims 'not persecuted' in France, says country's Muslim council",,"Mohammed Moussaoui, President of the French Council of the Muslim Faith (File photo)

PARIS: Muslims are ""not persecuted"" in France, the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) said Monday as a row over radical Islam and freedom of speech pits Muslim nations against Paris.

""France is a great country, Muslim citizens are not persecuted, they freely construct their mosques and they freely practise their religion,"" said the council, which acts as an official go-between for the state and observant Muslims.

French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to take the fight to Islamist radicals after the October 16 beheading of a history teacher who had shown cartoons of the Prophet Mohamed to pupils in a class discussion on free speech.

But a backlash against his comments saw protests in Muslim-majority countries over the weekend, with people burning pictures of Macron in Syria and setting fire to French flags in the Libyan capital Tripoli.

Boycotts of French goods are under way in supermarkets in Qatar and Kuwait, with further calls to spurn French products in Jordan, Turkey and other states.

The head of the CFCM, Mohammed Moussaoui , urged French Muslims on Monday to ""defend the interests"" of the nation in the face of the international outcry.

""We know that the promoters of these campaigns say they defend Islam and the Muslims of France, we urge them to be reasonable... all the smear campaigns against France are counterproductive and create division,"" he said.

Regarding cartoons of the Prophet Mohamed, viewed as offensive by many Muslims, Moussaoui said French law gave people ""the right to hate"" the cartoons.

But he said he supported the stance of Macron, who has vowed France would never relinquish cartoons or the right to mock religion.

Representatives of the CFCM are to meet Macron at the Elysee Palace later Monday.

"
US to get 9th justice with Dems powerless to block Barrett,,"WASHINGTON: A divided Senate is set to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, giving the country a ninth justice Monday as Republicans overpower Democratic opposition to secure President Donald Trump 's nominee the week before Election Day.

Democratic leaders asked Vice President Mike Pence to stay away from presiding over her Senate confirmation due to potential health risks after his aides tested positive for Covid-19. But although Pence isn't needed to break a tie, the vote would present a dramatic opportunity for him to preside over confirmation of Trump's third Supreme Court justice.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and his leadership team wrote that not only would Pence's presence violate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, ""it would also be a violation of common decency and courtesy.''

But Senate Republicans control the chamber and Barrett's confirmation isn't in doubt.

The 48-year-old Barrett would secure a conservative court majority for the foreseeable future, potentially opening a new era of rulings on abortion, gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act. A case against the Obama-era health law is scheduled to be heard Nov. 10.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scoffed at the ""apocalyptic'' warnings from critics that the judicial branch was becoming mired in partisan politics as he defended its transformation under his watch.

""This is something to be really proud of and feel good about,'' the Republican leader said Sunday during a rare weekend session.

McConnell said that unlike legislative actions that can be undone by new presidents or lawmakers, ""they won't be able to do much about this for a long time to come.''

Schumer, of New York, said the Trump administration's drive to install Barrett during the coronavirus crisis shows ""the Republican Party is willing to ignore the pandemic in order to rush this nominee forward.''

To underscore the potential health risks, Schumer urged his colleagues Sunday not to linger in the chamber but ""cast your votes quickly and from a safe distance.'' Some GOP senators tested positive for the coronavirus following a Rose Garden event with Trump to announce Barrett's nomination, but they have since said they have been cleared by their doctors from quarantine. Pence's office said the vice president tested negative for the virus on Monday.

The confirmation was expected to be the first of a Supreme Court nominee so close to a presidential election. It's also one of the first high court nominees in recent memory receiving no support from the minority party, a pivot from not long ago when a president's picks often won wide support.

Barrett presented herself in public testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee as a neutral arbiter and suggested, ""It's not the law of Amy.'' But her writings against abortion and a ruling on ""Obamacare'' show a deeply conservative thinker. She was expected to be seated quickly on the high court.

""She's a conservative woman who embraces her faith. She's unabashedly pro-life, but she's not going to apply `the law of Amy' to all of us,'' the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Fox News Channel.

At the start of Trump's presidency, McConnell engineered a Senate rules change to allow confirmation by a majority of the 100 senators, rather than the 60-vote threshold traditionally needed to advance high court nominees over objections. It was escalation of a rules change Democrats put in place to advance other court and administrative nominees under President Barack Obama.

On Sunday, the Senate voted 51-48 to begin to bring the process to a vote as senators, mostly Democrats, pulled an all-night session for the final 30 hours of often heated debate. Two Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted against advancing the nominee, and all Democrats who voted were opposed. California Sen. Kamala Harris, the vice presidential nominee, missed the vote while campaigning in Michigan.

Monday's final tally was expected to grow by one after Murkowski announced her support for the nominee, even as she decried filling the seat in the midst of a heated race for the White House. Murkowski said Saturday she would vote against the procedural steps but ultimately join GOP colleagues in confirming Barrett.

""While I oppose the process that has led us to this point, I do not hold it against her,'' Murkowski said.

Collins, who faces a tight reelection fight in Maine, remains the only Republican expected to vote against Trump's nominee. ""My vote does not reflect any conclusion that I have reached about Judge Barrett's qualifications to serve,'' Collins said. ""I do not think it is fair nor consistent to have a Senate confirmation vote prior to the election.''

By pushing for Barrett's ascension so close to the Nov. 3 election, Trump and his Republican allies are counting on a campaign boost, in much the way they believe McConnell's refusal to allow the Senate to consider Obama's nominee in February 2016 created excitement for Trump among conservatives and evangelical Christians eager for a Republican president to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia .

Barrett was a professor at Notre Dame Law School when she was tapped by Trump in 2017 for an appeals court opening. Two Democrats joined at that time to confirm her, but none is expected to vote for her now.

"
Pakistan summons French envoy over Macron's Islamist remarks,,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan summoned France's ambassador Monday to complain about a ""systematic Islamophobic campaign"" in the European nation after French President Emmanuel Macron criticised Islamists and defended the publication of religious cartoons.

The move came as small, scattered protests were held in cities across Pakistan and a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan accused Macron of ""attacking Islam"".

Foreign affairs ministry spokesman Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri told AFP the French ambassador had been summoned ""to convey Pakistan's concerns over (the) systematic Islamophobic campaign under the garb of freedom of expression"".

The French embassy in Islamabad did not immediately comment.

Macron spoke out last week after a Chechen extremist beheaded a French teacher near Paris after he had shown cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed during a class he was leading on free speech.

Macron said the teacher ""was killed because Islamists want our future"".

That comment compounded earlier controversy after the French premier this month said ""Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world"".

The teacher became the target of an online hate campaign over his choice of lesson material -- the same images that sparked a bloody assault by Islamist gunmen on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the original publisher, in January 2015.

Caricatures of Mohammed are forbidden by Islam and blasphemy is an explosive issue in ultra-conservative Pakistan, where anyone deemed to have insulted Islam or Islamic figures can face the death penalty.

A few dozen people rallied in Pakistani cities Monday including in Quetta and Peshawar, where protesters demanded a boycott of French goods and religious leaders called for larger demonstrations on Friday.

In the eastern city of Lahore, protesters set France's tricolour flag ablaze.

Last month, a Pakistan-born man admitted stabbing two people outside Charlie Hebdo's former Paris offices. According to investigators, he had wanted to avenge the magazine's republication of the cartoons.

Khan, a populist leader who has been known to play to Pakistan's hardline religious base, wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday asking the social media giant to take down Islamophobic content.

A Facebook representative said in a statement the company was against ""all forms of hate including hate targeting the Muslim community"".

WASHINGTON: - More than 60 million Americans have cast ballots in the US presidential election with eight days to go, a record-breaking pace that could lead to the highest voter turnout in over a century, according to data from the US Elections Project on Monday.

The tally is the latest sign of intense interest in the contest between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden, as well as voters' desire to reduce their risk of exposure to Covid-19, which has killed about 225,000 people across the United States.

An American publication, The Cut , landed itself in a soup when they reportedly published an article titled, “Is Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas ’ love for real?”The piece, that was first published on Tuesday, reportedly called Priyanka a “global scam artist” and insinuated that she is using Nick to strengthen her foothold in Hollywood. The piece even went as far as claiming that Nick allegedly “wed against his will.”The article sparked outrage among the actress’ fans, friends and family, who were quick to take to their social media accounts to slam the publication over the piece’s racist and sexist tone.Following the severe backlash, the website reportedly toned down the version of the article by removing certain allegations on Wednesday and chronicled the lead up to their wedding.“While this wedding and its trappings may feel familiar to other extremely public celebrations of celebrity love, well: We all know those marriages turned out,” the piece reportedly read.Images doing the rounds show the show some of the offensive bits that were removed from the article before it was taken down completely.After Nick’s brother Joe Jonas and future sister-in-law, Sophie Turner also stepped up to condemn the piece, the site took down the article and published an Editor’s note on Twitter that said, “Upon further editorial review, we found this story did not meet our standards. We’ve removed it and apologize.”Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas’ love story reportedly began at an Oscar after-party. The couple had a short courtship, after which they decided to tie the knot on December 1 and 2 in a Christian and Hindu wedding ceremony."

A few members (admin) of the website TamilRockers.com, which has been giving sleepless nights to Kollywood film makers and producers, were booked and arrested, on Thursday at Coimbatore. According to a source, it is the anti-piracy cell which tracked down the culprits who uploaded the pirated versions of Tamil, Telugu Malayalam and other language films on their site. The site is said to have connection with international piracy rackets, too.Interestingly, the site became popular among Tamil movie buffs owing to a fairly large demand and supply chain. There are many who have been depending on this website to watch films for a while now, and the demand witnessed a sudden rise before the release of Kabali, as the price of the tickets in the initial days cost a bomb. The makers of the film planned to initiate strict action against the site, coincidentally, another internationally popular piracy channel KickassTorrent went offline, as its host was arrested.

AI can predict students' educational outcomes based on tweets,,"NEW DELHI: Dear parents, please note. You may not need to ask teachers how your kid is performing in studies as his or her tweets will be enough to gauge whether he or she will make it big in the future or not, thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI).A team of Russian researchers has used AI-based models to predict high academic achievers from lower ones based on their social media posts.The prediction model uses a mathematical textual analysis that registers users' vocabulary (its range and the semantic fields from which concepts are taken), characters and symbols, post length and word length.Every word has its own rating (a kind of IQ). Scientific and cultural topics, English words, and words and posts that are longer in length rank highly and serve as indicators of good academic performance.An abundance of emojis, words or whole phrases written in capital letters, and vocabulary related to horoscopes, driving and military service indicate lower grades in school.""At the same time, posts can be quite short -- even tweets are quite informative,"" said Ivan Smirnov, leading research fellow at the Institute of Education of Higher School of Economics University in Moscow.The study traces the career paths of 4,400 students in 42 Russian regions.""Since this kind of data, in combination with digital traces, is difficult to obtain, it is almost never used,"" Smirnov said.This kind of dataset allows you to develop a reliable model that can be applied to other settings.""And the results can be extrapolated to all other students -- high school students and middle school students,"" Smirnov said in a paper published in the journal EPJ Data Science.The researchers said that it is important that the model worked successfully on datasets of different social media sites, such as VK (a Russian online social media and social networking service) and Twitter, thereby proving that it can be effective in different contexts.In addition, the model can be used to predict very different characteristics, from student academic performance to income or depression.The study data included data about the students' VK accounts (3,483 students consented to provide this information).In the study, unsupervised machine learning with word vector representations was performed on VK post corpus (totaling 1.9 billion words, with 2.5 million unique words).It was then combined with a simpler supervised machine learning model that was trained in individual positions and taught to predict PISA (Programme for International Students Assessment) scores.Posts from publicly viewable VK pages were used as a training sample -- this included a total of 130,575 posts from 2,468 subjects who took the PISA test.The test allowed the researcher to assess a student's academic aptitude as well as their ability to apply their knowledge in practice, the authors wrote."
India ranks 6th most positive about teachers in 35-country survey,,"LONDON: India ranks among the world's top 10 countries when it comes to valuing its teaching workforce, according to a new 35-country global survey-based report.‘Reading Between The Lines: What The World Really Thinks of Teachers', released by the UK-based Varkey Foundation last week, found that India was sixth when it comes to people's implicit, unconscious and automatic views on the status of teachers in the country.The Implicit Teacher Status analysis, which finds China, Ghana, Singapore, Canada and Malaysia ahead of India, ranks countries by respondents' automatic impressions of teachers when asked to indicate as quickly as possible whether, for example, they think teachers are trusted or untrusted, inspiring or uninspiring, caring or uncaring, intelligent or unintelligent, among other word associations.“This report proves that respecting teachers isn't only an important moral duty – it's essential for a country's educational outcomes,” said Sunny Varkey, Founder of the Varkey Foundation and the Global Teacher Prize.“Since the coronavirus pandemic first emerged, we have seen 1.5 billion learners across the world impacted by school and university closures. In these unprecedented times, now more than ever it is necessary to do all we can to ensure young people throughout the world have access to a good teacher,” he said.The report, which builds on the data gathered by the Global Teacher Status Index (GTSI) 2018 – a 35-country survey conducted from 1,000 representative respondents in each of the countries – confirms the link between teacher status and pupil attainment.The new report seeks to explain for the first time why “Implicit Teacher Status” varies between countries.It finds that teachers generally enjoy higher status in richer countries, and in countries which allot a greater fraction of public funds to education.For instance, India's expenditure on education as a percentage of government spending is 14 per cent. In Italy, which ranks 24th for Implicit Teacher Status, by comparison, it is only 8.1 per cent, whereas in Ghana, which ranks second, it is 22.1 per cent.The report coincides with the announcement of the finalists for the 2020 Global Teacher Prize, which includes Ranjitsinh Disale – a teacher from a village in Maharashtra who is in the running for the USD 1-million annual prize, to be unveiled later this year.“We created the Global Teacher Prize, which shines a light on the extraordinary work that teachers do around the world, to inspire people to talk about the great work of teachers. We have seen teachers go above and beyond to keep young people learning all over the world amid the Covid pandemic,” added Varkey.As part of the new report's analysis, Professor Peter Dolton of the University of Sussex and Doctor Robert De Vries of the University of Kent reassessed the GTSI data to find a remarkably strong positive correlation between Implicit Teacher Status and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results.PISA scores are significantly higher in countries where people implicitly view teachers more positively."
"IIT-Madras convocation held, technology gives event a touch of reality",,"CHENNAI: For the first time in its history, the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras conducted its convocation online on Sunday and over 2,300 degrees were awarded.The highlight of the 57th convocation was the use of 'mixed reality' technology which provided the event a touch of reality.Prof David J Gross, Nobel laureate and Chancellor's Chair of Theoretical Physics, University of California, who was the chief guest, said that for graduating students it was the beginning of application of knowledge that they acquired during their study.Pawan Goenka, Chairman, Board of Governors, IIT Madras and Managing Director, Mahindra and Mahindra, presided.""COVID-19 has accelerated the rate of tech adoption across streams of life. Changes which would have taken 5-6 years have happened in just about 3-4 months,"" Goenka said.Director of IIT Madras, Bhaskar Ramamurthi, who awarded degrees to the graduating students said classes were completed on time due to the ""heroic efforts"" of the faculty and students.As many as 191 patents were filed during the year, of which 62 were international, and the institute was granted 58, he said.A total of 2,346 degrees were awarded to 1,909 students in absentia.Mixed reality creates visualisations by combining real and virtual worlds.For instance, a student, Rajat Vadiraj Dwaraknath, who bagged three prizes including the President of India gold medal appeared to have personally received the medal though it was only a projection that seemed real."

Coronavirus: Has India reached any closer to herd immunity?,2020-10-23 19:37:03+05:30,"After months long spell of high daily infection spikes, India might be close to surpassing the peak of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Recent reports suggest that the daily number of new infections have indeed lowered down.

The country is also seeing a higher than ever recovery rate for COVID-19 patients. Work on COVID vaccines is also going on at full swing, with the earliest doses being promised for the masses by January. The rather positive glimmer of hope has given rise to the fact that soon enough, India might be ""safe"" from the pandemic. According to a recent study, the case trajectory might not just mean we have surpassed the peak of COVID-19, but somewhere close to reaching herd immunity.

What does the study suggest?

A study published by the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR) mentions that nearly 38 million (or 380 crores) Indians have already been infected by the virus, whether symptomatically or asymptomatically. Several serosurveys, conducted in the past months have also found the presence of high antibody levels in cities and towns, which were pegged to be some of the worst-affected parts struck by the pandemic."
Coronavirus: Here's why COVID patients experience loss of hair,2020-10-23 11:00:00+05:30,"So what causes loss of hair in Covid-19 patients is what everyone wants to know at the moment. Although, the cause of the symptoms has not been scientifically proven, many have suggested that it could be in relation to stress and anxiety prompted by the disease itself. Known as ‘Telogen effluvium’, this kind of temporary hair loss happens when your body experiences a lot of stress, in the form of trauma, shock or sickness.

Besides that, nutritional deficiency due to the lack of healthy diet during the period of infection, can also result in hair loss. However, without scientific proofs, nothing can be certain."
Coronavirus recovery: Most common post-COVID signs which could indicate signs of long term trouble,2020-10-15 19:13:28+05:30,"Thrombosis refers to the formation of blood clots in the blood vessels, which prohibits proper blood flow through the body's circulatory system. In some cases, a reduced, or compromised blood flow could lead to an increased risk of some patients developing blood clots in the veins that cause leg clots (deep vein thrombosis) and pulmonary embolism. Experts say COVID-19, of all diseases, carries the most risk for increased rates of thrombosis for patients who are infected by it, as well as those who have tested negative. This is far more damaging for someone who is immuno-compromised or is suffering from diabetes. It is for the same reason that patients diagnosed with COVID and those who have pre-existing medical issues are advised to take blood thinners like aspirin on a prophylactic basis to cut down on chances of complications."

Trump's '60 Minutes' tantrum told us everything (opinion),2020-10-26 00:00:00,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the upcoming book ""High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) There was little more than a week to go. Polls showed him losing to a man he called ""the worst candidate in the history of politics."" But the President had one last chance to reach a vast number of Americans with his message. What did he do with this great opportunity?

He entered whining -- and left in a huff.

In the traditional end-of-campaign interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Donald Trump showed that his comfort zone is still his bad boy stage persona. He insulted Lesley Stahl, a mild-mannered interrogator if there ever was one, by trying to cast her as a villain. He accused her and her program of being mean to him and favoring his opponent.

""You're so negative, you're so negative,"" Trump groused at one point. At another, he complained, ""You're really quite impossible to convince,"" as if he was there to make a sale instead of discussing the pandemic, the economy and his other responsibilities. Then, after 37 minutes of this, he abruptly declared ""that's enough"" and left.

As drama, Trump's schtick was stale to the point of pathetic. Echoing the days after his inauguration, he offered nonsense about the size of his rally crowds. He aired rabbit-hole theories about his opponent, Joe Biden. He even tried to revive a supposed scandal involving Hillary Clinton, as if summoning her name would energize his supporters.

Energizing the most rabid element of his base seemed to be Trump's only purpose and to do that he sought to pose as a warrior. ""You have to fight back,"" he said. ""And if you don't fight back, you're not sitting here very long. You go back home. You go back home to mommy."" With this he sounded more like an angry boy in the schoolyard than like someone we should trust with very adult problems.

The adult on the program turned out to be Biden, who was interviewed by Norah O'Donnell during the same show. Despite what Trump claimed, she did not toss Biden ""softball after softball."" In fact, she pressed him on his age, 78, and whether he was up to the job. She asked about the controversial question of adding more justices to the Supreme Court and how Biden would manage taxes and spending as he dealt with the economic effects of the pandemic.

In each response, Biden did sound quite like the conventional politicians whom many assume to represent a sclerotic system. But he did actually answer the questions. Asked about unfounded suggestions that he has dementia, Biden said: ""Look at me. Compare our physical and mental acuity. I'm happy to have that comparison."" He explained his plan to raise taxes on high earners, and on expanding the Supreme Court, he promised no precipitous action but rather a commission to study the matter.

The commission idea might be a classic political dodge, but there is something reassuring about this go-slow approach to a controversy. Biden was clearly trying to turn down the heat, and after four years of red-hot rhetoric from Trump, this approach seemed less hackneyed than mature.

In the end, the difference between the Biden and Trump interviews was not the quality of the questions but the tenor of the replies. Trump established a tone of conflict, refusing to truly dialogue. And in his usual fashion he produced a string of misleading statements and out-and-out falsehoods, according to fact checkers. Biden may have dodged at times and CBS fact-checked claims that were somewhat askew. However, Biden generally engaged in the conversation, as if he respected the role of journalists who ask questions that could help voters make their choices.

""I think the contrast between Donald Trump and me is about as stark as it can get in terms of our value set and how we view the world,"" Biden said.

As if to prove his point, Trump's press secretary Kayleigh McEnany came into the room after Trump's interview to hand Stahl a giant, bound book . She said it was Trump's long-awaited health care plan. It was, as Stahl told viewers, nothing of the sort. It was just a pile of papers -- executive orders, legislative initiatives -- not a plan at all.

Like the crowd-size discussion, the bogus book echoed past Trump performances when he has presented stacks of blank papers and empty files that supposedly indicate he has the facts and evidence to back up his claims. This is stagecraft, not statecraft, and at this point the method only calls attention to the president's shortcomings.

The blessing in Trump's ""60 Minutes"" performance is that it did help make the voters' choice clear. Both men are, in a sense, offering more of the same. Trump assures more drama. Biden promises a return to the steady and familiar."
Patrick Mahomes breaks NFL touchdown pass record as the Kansas City Chiefs bounce back to win,2020-10-20 00:00:00,"(CNN) And just like that Patrick Mahomes broke a NFL touchdown pass record as the Kansas City Chiefs got back to winning ways against the Buffalo Bills.

The quarterback threw two touchdown passes to inspire the Chiefs to a 26-17 win on Monday as they bounced back from a disappointing loss to the Las Vegas Raiders last time out.

With his first touchdown pass of the night, Mahomes became the fastest player in the Super Bowl era to reach 90 touchdown passes, doing so in just 37 games. The previous mark was set by Hall of Famer Dan Marino, who reached the landmark in 40 games.

Travis Kelce received both of Mahomes' touchdown passes as the quarterback recorded a touchdown pass in his 16th consecutive game.

New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees leads the NFL all-time passing touchdown list with 556 passes.

Australia's coronavirus epicenter records no new cases as the US and Western Europe struggle to contain the pandemic,2020-10-26 00:00:00,"(CNN) Melbourne, the city at the epicenter of Australia's coronavirus epidemic, will move out of lockdown this week after the Victoria state health department on Sunday reported no new cases and no deaths due to the virus for the first time in more than four months.

Announcing the relaxation of restrictions at a news conference on Monday, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said starting on Tuesday at 11:59 p.m., Melbourne residents will be allowed to leave their homes and most businesses in the state can reopen with restrictions on the number of people.

""With 0 cases and so much testing, we are able to say that now is the time to open up. Now is the time to congratulate every single Victorian who has stayed the course,"" Andrews said.

The remarkable milestone of no new cases comes just months after Andrews declared a ""state of disaster"" to stem an outbreak that saw as many as 725 people in the state test positive for the virus in a single day

The steep decline in cases has allowed the government to lift major social distancing measures that have been in place for weeks.

As cases began skyrocketing this summer, Andrews put in place the type of strict anti-epidemic measures that governments in Western Europe and the United States have been hesitant to enact out of fear of damaging the economy and trampling on civil liberties.

From a public health standpoint, Andrews' decision appeared to have worked. While cases in Europe continue to skyrocket to record-breaking levels and US President Donald Trump's chief of staff said the United States ""will not be able to contain the pandemic,"" Victoria appears to have done just that.

East Asian governments including those in China, South Korea and Taiwan have not needed to put in place such restrictions because early efforts to contain the virus focused on testing and contact tracing, combined with the readiness of their respective populations to wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines, which helped keep the pandemic in check.

Andrews said Victoria was able to rein in the pandemic because of the public's willingness to endure hardship, listen to the science and follow the rules.

""I could not be prouder than I am today to lead a state that has showed the courage, the compassion, and the character to get this job done. But it is not yet absolutely finished,"" he said.

""We have to be vigilant in the weeks and months ... until a vaccine comes, there is no normal. There is only Covid-normal.""

Under the relaxed measures, staff are allowed to immediately return to their businesses in order to prepare for customers and put in place anti-epidemic measures.

Some restrictions, including a 25-kilometer (15-mile) limit on travel and an internal border between Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne, will remain in place until November 8.

Though Victoria, as of Monday, accounts for at least 20,300 of Australia's more than 27,500 cases and 817 of the country's 905 deaths, the number of active cases in Victoria has steadily declined in the past 30 days . The number of new infections has been in single digits since October 13 and has not exceeded 20 in the past month.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison congratulated the state for the drop in Covid-19 cases and lauded Victorians for the making ""great progress in reducing the rate of Covid-19 infection.""

""They have played their part and sacrificed much in the pursuit of reaching those targets in the belief restrictions would be eased,"" he said.

Morrison added that Victoria would open state borders by Christmas. They were closed as part of the federal government's response to the pandemic.

Winter lockdown

Victoria and its capital Melbourne faced Australia's worst outbreak of Covid-19 this Australian winter.

Andrews declared the disaster in early August as Victoria was recording hundreds of cases per day, while the federal government closed the state's borders to non-essential travel. The state's government instituted some of the strictest social distancing measures in the country, including placing Melbourne's 5 million residents under a seven-week lockdown and barring nearly all trips outdoors.

Andrews said Monday the government was not going to be ""pushed by the loudest voices"" to reopen before public health experts deemed it was safe to do so.

The draconian restrictions were kept in place for quite some time, even as the state's case count and the number of fatalities began dropping

By late September , cases has declined to low double-digits, allowing the government to lift Melbourne's curfew.

Andrews hinted earlier this month that authorities were considering lifting more restrictions if trends continued in the right direction. However, a small cluster of cases in Melbourne's northern suburbs prompted him to put in place a ""cautious pause"" in order to test more than 4,000 residents, further delaying reopening.

Nearly all tests have come back negative. Andrews said health authorities can now rule out widespread community transmission.

""It was worth waiting to be sure,"" he said.

A previous version of this story misstated Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews' political affiliation. This has been corrected."

"SARS: Nigerian youth, celebrities protest against controversial police unit accused of brutality",2020-10-09 00:00:00,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigeria's leading celebrities and activists have organized mass protests across major cities in the country Friday demanding an end to police brutality in the country.

The nationwide protests were a culmination of weeks of anger and outcry online by the country's young people over claims of kidnapping, harassment and extortion by a police unit known as the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS).

On Thursday, a protest was led in Lagos Island by Folarin Falana, a lawyer and singer, and Runtown, an artist known by that stage name.

Falana, who is popularly known as Falz, told CNN it was important for him to march because there have been ""too many numerous incidents of harassment, extortion and police brutality,"" in the country. He added that he, too, had been a victim of harassment at the hands of the Nigerian police.

Tomorrow morning we move out for the #EndSARSprotest ! We are not out to cause trouble, but our voices must be heard! 10am we link up at the Lekki toll gate. #EndSars

""People have been posting online about it for years, but it has been the same sluggish attitude and response to it. Nothing has changed and people keep on being harassed. That's why we have taken to the streets and we want the government to listen,"" he said.

""I am marching for the ones that are not recognized. We are surprised by the numbers that came out and we are prepared to march again,"" he added.

Protests continue into the night

Overnight protests were also held in Lagos mainland Thursday outside the Lagos State Assembly as organizers carried placards and knelt down, chanting 'End SARS .'

A group of protesters, led by Debo Adebayo, a comedian by the stage name of Mr Macaroni, held a protest vigil , running into the third night in a row, in Alausa, Lagos.

Videos from the protesters shared on Twitter Thursday night showed police officers forcefully dispersing the protesters, dismantling their sleeping tents, turning off the street lights and making verbal threats.

Nigeria's police force had responded to the public outcry last Sunday by banning the unit from carrying out any stop-and-search activities.

SARS, as well as other tactical police units, are now prohibited from ""carrying out routine patrols and other conventional low-risk. duties -- stop and search duties, checkpoints, mounting of roadblocks, traffic checks, etc -- with immediate effect,"" Nigeria police chief Mohammed Adamu said on Sunday in a statement.

""Voices and complaints on the issues of unprofessional conducts by some SARS operatives have been heard very loudly and clearly,"" the statement read.

Feyikemi Abudu was among the protesters outside the Lagos State Assembly in Ikeja on Friday. She told CNN their demands were presented to the assembly, which held an emergency session Friday to listen to their demands.

""There are many demands, but the main one is to scrap SARS, not to reform it but to completely end it. Another demand is compensation for victims of SARS brutality, both alive and dead. We also want a committee that will investigate and look into the present and past grievances around SARS brutality, "" Abudu said.

Abudu also told CNN she has raised 1.3 million naira (about $3,390) to buy food for those protesting and for medical treatment for those injured during the protests.

Media personality Toke Makinwa was also among those who protested. ""People are constantly calling my show with reports of harassment,"" she said.

""One man told me they pulled his phone and searched his banking app, they took him to an ATM to withdraw money for them. Nigeria has reduced its citizens to doing everything by themselves. SARS should not be one of the problems we have to face. You are supposed to be anti-robbery but we are afraid of you. People who are meant to protect are the ones oppressing us.""

CNN put this and other allegations to the Nigerian police force, and Lagos state spokesman Muyiwa Adejobi said that all complaints against its officers are carefully investigated and appropriate sanctions applied to offenders.

Adejobi added that many people rarely report the abuses because they fear that they may not get justice. He encouraged people affected by police misconduct to report the abuses.

'A lack of political will'

The police say that the ban on the SARS unit is one of many steps towards reforming the outfit.

However, this ban is not the first time authorities in Nigeria have censured the SARS unit.

In 2018, the country's Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo , while deputizing for the President who was out of the country on vacation at the time, ordered the unit to be overhauled. In January 2019, the police announced another ban on the same police unit.

But the human rights organization Amnesty Nigeria says not much has changed since these bans were put in place.

""A similar ban on SARS did not end police brutality because it appeared the bans were simply done to assuage the swelling public anger at the time of the announcement and not intended to end police brutality,"" Amnesty Nigeria's program manager, Seun Bakare, said.

In an email to CNN, he said as a result of past campaigns, some reforms like ""the passage of the anti-torture act 2017, the signing of the new police act"" and other minor amendments have been passed.

The anti-torture act of 2017, for example, is supposed to protect Nigerians, including suspects and detainees from torture and inhumane treatment. However, there seems to be a lack of political will to enforce these laws, Bakare said.

'Nothing will happen if I shoot you,'

The hashtag #EndSARS, #StopPolicebrutality has continued to trend on Twitter as young people shared their stories, photos and videos that they allege show men in Nigeria police uniforms searching their cars and harassing them.

Lagos-based entrepreneur Samuel Otigba told CNN he has had several encounters with members of the police that he believes to be from the SARS unit. He said the encounters usually begin with requests for bribes. Otigba alleges that in May, he got into trouble because he declined to give a bribe to one of the officers when he was stopped after an evening out with his wife.

He says his phone was searched and he was threatened by the officer who told him, ""You know if I shoot you, nothing will happen. The highest anyone will do is cry justice on Twitter.""

Otigba recounted another encounter earlier this year when another set of officers, who were wearing masks, he said, stopped him and his wife again after a night out in Lagos state.

""Six of them jumped out of their mini bus and started pointing guns at us, commanding us to get out of our car. We thought they were armed robbers. We were all so scared and my wife was crying,"" Otigba told CNN.

This time he says he paid the officers 20,000 naira (around $52) before they were let go. He said he did not report the incident.

Adejobi, the police spokesman, said only incidents that are reported are investigated.

'Carrying laptops not a crime'

Many tech entrepreneurs say they are targeted for having things like tattoos and dreadlocks, or simply for carrying laptops and smartphones.

Between 2017 and 2020, Amnesty International said it has documented 82 cases of police brutality in Nigeria.

""Detainees in SARS custody have been subjected to a variety of methods of torture including hanging, mock execution, beating, punching and kicking, burning with cigarettes, waterboarding, near-asphyxiation with plastic bags, forcing detainees to assume stressful bodily positions and sexual violence,"" Amnesty's report said.

Nigeria police chief Mohammed Adamu warned against ""the invasion of the privacy of citizens particularly through indiscriminate and unauthorized search of mobile phones, laptops, and other smart devices,"" while Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osinbajo recently held a meeting with police chiefs over the issue, according to a statement from the Presidency.

Osinbajo said the president is ""very concerned about it, and ... wants to see reform.""

""You cannot have a situation where SARS says they are investigating cybercrime by arresting young men and women carrying their laptops and phones. I don't see how you can investigate that by seizing people's phones in a taxi or in their cars,"" according to tweets attributed to Osinbajo."
The World Trade Organization should enforce its own rules (opinion),2019-10-10 00:00:00,"Chuck Grassley, a Republican, is a United States senator from Iowa andchairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, is a United States senator from Oregon and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.

With the World Trade Organization Public Forum underway in Geneva, it is time for members to confront and address the problems that are eroding the WTO's credibility and effectiveness. These are problems that, if left unresolved, will endanger the WTO's future relevance.

Today, the WTO is where nations negotiate the rules for international trade and resolve disputes that arise when a trading partner believes the rules aren't being followed. This trading system has been critical to helping reduce global poverty rates, which have shrunk even while the global population has expanded.

We support the WTO's mission, but we are growing frustrated that the institution is not fully and effectively performing its intended functions.

First, while the WTO was intended to be a forum for multilateral trade negotiations, it has proven difficult to come to agreements that give a fair shot to all nations, not just wealthier countries that can subsidize their industries.

In addition, some WTO members that have advanced economies are claiming ""developing country status"" in order to avoid their trade obligations. For years, economic powerhouses, like China, have relied on this self-designation to shirk WTO commitments in critical areas such as agriculture and illegal subsidies. This hinders progress for members that want to expand trade and commerce and undermines the integrity of the WTO itself. This is why we support the US proposal to change the way the WTO treats developing countries, which is targeted at strengthening the negotiating function of the organization.

Still, two ongoing projects offer the WTO a chance to get it right. Negotiations are underway to curtail the fish subsidies that have long promoted overfishing and unfair competition and to decrease barriers to e-commerce and digitally-supported trade. If concluded, these agreements would demonstrate that the WTO can still serve as the institution it was intended to be.

Second, while the WTO serves as a forum to settle disputes among its members, we have serious concerns about the degree to which the system is working. The Appellate Body -- the quasi-judicial review forum used to take a second look into dispute decisions -- has long strayed off course from its original form and function. Our concerns about systemic and procedural problems with the Appellate Body are not new, nor are they partisan. US presidents on both sides of the aisle have taken issue with Appellate Body members addressing issues that were not raised by the parties to involved in the dispute, taking longer than 90 days to decide appeals, and creating new rights and obligations for WTO members -- all against the terms of the Dispute Settlement Understanding

We see great value in having an institution like the Appellate Body that ensures dispute panels faithfully apply the rules to which we all agreed. However, the Appellate Body also needs to operate as the members agreed.

Lastly, the WTO must improve its ability to monitor member states' trade policies and practices. Some WTO members, like China, consistently fail to meet their obligations to accurately report the subsidies they provide to domestic industries. In other cases, members have failed to disclose measures that affect international trade, such as India's ban on US agricultural products for alleged safety concerns, which the WTO ultimately found to be disguised protectionism, or China's various cybersecurity requirements on information and communication technology.

This is unacceptable. A number of countries regularly take advantage of other WTO members that comply with notification and transparency rules while ignoring their own obligations. The United States has advocated for measures that would incentivize the member states to abide by the rules by providing for consequences in cases of noncompliance, such as loss of privileges to chair WTO bodies.

Undoubtedly, there is a lot of work to do to fix these problems. The United States has long been a leader on these issues, but we can't do it alone.

The United States, Japan and the European Union have been discussing WTO reforms. Partnerships like this are essential to showing member states who consistently break the rules that their actions won't be tolerated. We encourage and welcome others to join us in these efforts.

The Bretton Woods experiment following World War II, which established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) alongside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and the resulting creation of the WTO nearly half a century later, wasn't just about advancing US interests alone, it was about advancing our collective interests. For the WTO to succeed in this mission, its members must acknowledge its shortcomings -- particularly when it comes to enforcing or negotiating rules to confront unfair trade practices -- and work toward solutions to fix them."

How Lewis Hamilton's brother Nicolas overcame his disability to become a racing driver,2020-10-08 00:00:00,"(CNN) Nicolas Hamilton grew up around the racetrack. But unlike his older half-brother Lewis, who is a six-time Formula One world champion, Nicolas never thought he'd get the chance to race competitively.

The younger Hamilton has cerebral palsy -- a disorder which affects around one in every 400 children in the UK and is the most common childhood motor disability, globally.

""I didn't think I would have the opportunity to race,"" explains Hamilton, who is now 28, seven years younger than Lewis.

The condition affects Hamilton's legs and balance, preventing him from being able to flex his ankles and use conventional foot pedals when driving.

Yet, this season, he became the first disabled driver to score points in the British Touring Car Championship -- a racing series established in 1958.

Hamilton can compete thanks to a specially modified car.

Adapting the car

Hamilton's car has a hand clutch on the steering wheel, which allows him to minimize the use of his legs.

JUST WATCHED How Nicolas Hamilton, brother of Lewis, overcame his disability to become a racing driver Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How Nicolas Hamilton, brother of Lewis, overcame his disability to become a racing driver 03:29

Made of carbon fiber, the hand clutch operates like a regular foot pedal, says Hamilton. ""When you release the clutch and you feel the bite point ... I just have that through my hands.""



Read: Wearable tech helps this blind runner compete in ultramarathons To make the accelerator and brake pedals easier to use, they are extra-wide and positioned so that Hamilton does not need to fully extend his legs. He also has a seat that has been specially molded for his body.

He is currently the only disabled driver in the championship, racing against 30 able-bodied athletes at speeds of up to 130 miles per hour.

This season, Hamilton came 15th in a race, scoring him one point. ""I'm the first disabled athlete to have done that,"" he says. ""Getting closer to the front of the grid, I want to get to the top 10, top five.""

Hamilton says because he faces a lot of challenges, ""it's going to be sweeter when I eventually go on that podium.""

Racing ahead

. Hamilton says he had a challenging childhood. When he was a baby his parents were told he would never walk and then there was also the issue of race to contend with

""I got bullied and got pulled backwards in my wheelchair and laughed at,"" he says of his time at school, adding: ""I was the only Black person at my school, so I was very singled out.""

Supported by his family, Hamilton had a major operation, and did years of physiotherapy to strengthen his legs, so that by age 17 he could walk unassisted

Aged seven, his dad gave him the chance to drive a go-kart in a car park , and like his brother Lewis, go-karting sparked a passion for racing.

""Motorsport gave me a purpose,"" he says. ""It gave me a reason to overcome my condition.""

Last year, Hamilton helped launch the UK's first race academy for disabled drivers, Team BRIT.

The academy aims to give any disabled driver with a full UK driving license the chance to receive race coaching, mentoring or tuition. It estimates there are two million disabled drivers in the UK.

""I would love to see disabled people be able to access circuits and access the industry,"" says Hamilton. ""Hopefully, through this academy, we can give people more opportunities, more happiness, more purpose."""
Lewis Hamilton ties Michael Schumacher with 91st F1 win,2020-10-11 00:00:00,"(CNN) History was made at the Nürburgring on Sunday as Lewis Hamilton equaled Michael Schumacher's F1 record of 91 wins with an emphatic victory in the Eifel Grand Prix.

Hamilton took the lead from his Mercedes teammate and polesitter Valtteri Bottas early in the 60-lap race at the famous German circuit and dominated proceedings without serious challenge from second-placed Max Verstappen in the Red Bull.

Bottas retired through loss of engine power, leaving the way clear for Australian Daniel Ricciardo to claim the final podium spot for Renault with Sergio Perez of Mexico fourth in the Racing Point.

The seventh victory of a truncated season for Britain's Hamilton has taken him 69 points clear of Bottas in the championship race and well on course to win his seventh world title to bring him level with another of Schumacher's all-time records.

"El Clasico may not have the same allure as years gone by, but Camp Nou meeting still intrigues",2020-10-23 00:00:00,"(CNN) Saturday's El Clasico will be an El Clasico like no other. Widely viewed as the most watched club game in the world, when Barcelona take on Real Madrid at the Camp Nou this weekend, the match will be played behind closed doors.

""The game will be strange, as when you play at home in these kinds of games the fans are almost an extra man,"" Ronald Koeman told the Barcelona website. ""We hope that soon we can have our supporters back at the stadium.""

But this latest installment in the El Clasico series is also unusual in that it could be the last time Lionel Messi features against Real at the Camp Nou.

Between 2009 and 2018 the rivalry between Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo was the beguiling sub-plot to each El Clasico meeting.

However long gone are the days when fans would marvel at the sight of Ronaldo and Messi doing battle at the peak of their careers. In fact, Ronaldo is gone completely, now plying his trade at Juventus, and Messi ... well, Messi wishes he was gone, too.

Barcelona looks to be counting the cost of forcing a player -- the best player in the club's history, no less -- to stay against his wishes, with Messi's performances dipping this season after publicly saying he had wanted to leave ""all year.""

The Argentine, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers in history, has since said he remains motivated to bring success to Barcelona this season, but that is certainly easier said than done once your heart is set on a move away.

Ansu Fati celebrates with Lionel Messi after scoring a goal during the UEFA Champions League football match between FC Barcelona and Ferencvarosi TC at the Camp Nou stadium on Tuesday.

Messi's performances have understandably dipped way below his own supernatural standards, with only two goals in five games so far this season and both of those coming from the penalty spot.

Fortunately for Barcelona, it has a thrilling new prospect on its hands in 17-year-old Ansu Fati, who is providing fans with hope that there may yet be life after Messi.

Fati, who became Spain's youngest ever goalscorer in the recent international break, already has four goals in five games this season to cement his place as Barcelona's top scorer.

New boss Koeman had guided Barcelona to a solid start in La Liga, with two wins and a draw from his opening three games as head coach. However, last Saturday's surprise 1-0 defeat to Getafe exposed many of the flaws that have plagued Barcelona in recent times.

It's no secret that the team has been painfully overly reliant on Messi over the past few seasons and it may now finally have to find a way to succeed without leaning heavily on the Argentine's shoulders.

The wounds from that 8-2 Champions League humiliation to Bayern Munich in last season's quarterfinals remain fresh and, perhaps most worryingly of all, Barcelona has arguably only fallen even further behind the standards currently being set by Bavarian club.

Messi shakes hands with Barca coach Ronald Koeman after he is substituted during the pre-season friendly match between FC Barcelona and Girona at Estadi Johan Cruyff on September 16, 2020.

Tuesday's 5-1 win against Hungarian club Ferencvaros will have earned Barcelona some brief respite, but triumphing in an El Clasico will do wonders for Koeman's standing at the Catalan club.

Clash of the crisis clubs

Fortunately for Barcelona, Saturday's El Clasico certainly won't be a match Real Madrid is relishing either.

Zinedine Zidane's side has endured an even more turbulent few days than their rivals, following up its shock weekend defeat to newly-promoted Cadiz -- playing in its first La Liga season for 15 years -- with an equally surprising home defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League.

With one eye on Saturday's La Liga clash against Barcelona, Real made several changes to its regular starting lineup, but there could be no excuses for such an insipid and lifeless first-half performance.

Shakhtar Donetsk beat Real Madrid 3-2 in a stunning Champions League win on Wednesday.

Incredibly, Shakhtar was without seven starting players -- and 10 in total -- due to a combination of positive coronavirus cases and injuries.

""I've won a lot with these players, they've won a lot for me and I'll always be with them until the end, it's they who battle, run and fight and I can feel their support,"" said Zidane, per Reuters, looking ahead to Saturday's game.

""But right now the most important thing is changing the dynamic, and we've got good games coming up to be able to do that in, and that's what makes football so great. When things go wrong, you need to show your character and quality.

""I can't deny people are saying my future is at stake, but it was the same last year and it was like that in my first spell here, too. I just need to do my job and forget about everything else.""

Real Madrid has gradually improved since Zidane was re-hired as head coach in March 2019, its resurgence culminating a first La Liga title since 2017 at the end of last season -- though perhaps, in hindsight, that win was more by proxy given Barcelona's shambolic form following the restart.

Much like Barcelona, Real has some exciting prospects that are allowing fans to dream the future may be bright. Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior has continued his development as one of Europe's finest attacking players, while left-back Ferland Mendy is cementing his place as Marcelo's heir apparent.

For both clubs, it remains to be seen whether the recent results and performances are just a small blip or an indication of the struggles ahead this season.

Real coach Zinedine Zidane has presided over successive defeats -- first to Cadiz in La Liga and then Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League.

While Real and Barca may no longer be at their previous peaks, perhaps more accurately resembling two lumbering heavyweight boxers in the twilight of their careers, the precarious position in which both teams and managers find themselves arguably makes Saturday's clash an even more meaningful occasion."
Tiger Woods and Justin Thomas win mic'd up tournament,2020-09-23 00:00:00,"(CNN) Who knew Rory McIlroy was such a fan of Domino's pizza and that Justin Thomas was the king of trash talk?

During the Payne's Valley Cup -- a Ryder Cup-style tournament where players are fitted with microphones for fans to listen in -- McIlroy declared his love for the pizza chain, much to the amusement of Thomas.

We also found out that Thomas struggles to sleep with a stuffed raccoon starring at him. Justin Rose quipped he had a similar problem but with pictures of Tiger Woods . That brought a huge grin to Woods' face.

The four were competing in the Team US vs. Team Europe exhibition match to mark the opening Payne's Valley Golf Course at Big Cedar Lodge in Ridgedale, Missouri -- the first public golf course designed by Woods' TGR Design firm.

A general view of the 18th hole of the Payne's Valley course.

Woods and Thomas represented the US, while McIlroy and Rose featured for Europe.

All four competitors have been world No. 1s, are major champions, have won the FedExCup and have been part of victorious Ryder Cup teams.

""You hate to see that.""



There's always that one friend 🙄pic.twitter.com/zNn6wdrEUO — GOLFTV (@GOLFTV) September 22, 2020

The teams competed over 19 holes and three different formats -- six holes of four-ball, six of alternate shots and seven of singles play. Team Europe won the first point after six holes of foursomes, but Team US won one point themselves in the alternate shot format, with Rose then beating Woods and Thomas defeating McIlroy in the singles.

The 19th bonus hole doubled up as a closest-to-the-pin decider to settle the contest -- with two all-time greats, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, also playing -- after it finished in a 2-2- draw. Thomas hit the closest tee shot to secure the victory for Team US.

And while fans tuned in to see some excellent golf, it turned out to be the conversations and joking between the players that stole the show.

After learning about Thomas and Rose's struggles to sleep, viewers were treated to the players ribbing each other when one made a mistake -- led by Thomas -- and learning about McIlroy's pizza passion.

After Rose hooked a drive way off to the left on the third hole, 2017 PGA Championship winner Thomas could be heard saying: ""That's got to be 150 yards off line.""

Later on the 14th, after a putt from McIlroy clipped the lip but agonizingly rolled out, Thomas consolidated the Northern Irishman, saying: ""You hate to see it.""

McIlroy did bite back later, saying he was supposed to give Thomas a lift home, but if he kept on talking, that might change.

Thomas also complained about Woods having his name on their shared ball, referring to the 15-time major winner as ""dumb-dumb.""

It wasn't all trash talk between the group though. Fans were given an insight into the level of detail players go into when they prepare their game.

An aerial view of the 19th hole for the Payne's Valley Cup.

On the very first hole, Woods and Rose could be heard discussing about shafts and backswings. McIlroy explained to Rose and Thomas how his new hybrid club spins less than the other ones he tried.

And while it was good to see the professionals relax, the PGA Tour season soon ramps up, with the CJ Cup -- where Thomas is the reigning champion -- and the Zozo Championship -- Woods won in 2019 -- taking place in October before the rescheduled Masters in November."
Ryder Cup: The inside story of golf's biggest postponement,2020-09-26 00:00:00,"(CNN) September's final weekend in 2020 had been locked in sports fans' diaries ever since the final putt at Le Golf National in France in 2018: the return of golf's greatest spectacle.

A weekend where the drive for individual glory gives way to a need to succeed for the team. Where suddenly any concern over prize money or world ranking is forgone for the sheer pride of representing your country, or your continent.

It was meant to be the weekend of the 43rd Ryder Cup, fought between Team USA and Team Europe. But it isn't.

A sporting event's cancellation -- or in this case, postponement -- is nothing new in 2020, a year in which virtually every tournament, league, and village table tennis championship has been affected in one way or another by Covid-19.

But sitting where it did in the calendar, in late September, for a while it seemed some small tweaks to the format might allow the Ryder Cup to go ahead.

""Things started coming to a head in March when they started closing down the tours,"" Team Europe's captain, Padraig Harrington, told CNN's Living Golf.

Padraig Harrington competed in six Ryder Cups as a player, winning four of them.

""At that stage we started making all sorts of alternative options, what we'd do with picking the team, how we get in the right amount of play, and just making all different scenarios for selection, qualification, picks, timings, all that.""

But as the pandemic spread and the early optimism over fans returning to the grandstands faded, hope quickly diminished and in July, the decision was announced that Whistling Straits -- the Wisconsin course hosting the event -- would have to wait another year, as the Ryder Cup was postponed until September 2021.

No fans, no Ryder Cup

With the PGA Tour resuming in June, and the European Tour following suit in July, it was clear that golf could still go ahead in pandemic conditions. But for the Ryder Cup, it wasn't as simple as just playing behind closed doors.

The organizers and players knew this was a tournament that needed fans.

In July, European Tour CEO Keith Pelley told CNN: ""If you couldn't guarantee 15 or 20,000 fans, then the Ryder Cup is not the Ryder Cup. It is tribal in nature. And that first tee experience is the best experience in golf undeniably. If you couldn't have that, would that be detrimental to the Ryder Cup? I personally felt it would.""

Throughout the lengthy decision-making process, Pelley was in near-daily contact with his counterpart Jay Monahan, Commissioner of the PGA Tour, but also with some of Team Europe's star players.

""I remember saying to Rory [McIlroy], 'Who are you going to raise your hands to? Patrick Reed's caddy? Who's Patrick going to shush? The marshal?' That's the magic of the Ryder Cup.""

JUST WATCHED European Tour CEO: Why the Ryder Cup was postponed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH European Tour CEO: Why the Ryder Cup was postponed 00:50

Having played in six Ryder Cups between 1999 and 2010, Harrington understands the importance of the crowd to the event.

""The buzz, the excitement, the pressure, the stress. Everything that the crowd brings to it, it just lifts you up during the week. I don't think it would be a Ryder Cup without it.""

The impact of a fanless tournament would have stretched beyond the course.

The 2018 match at Le Golf National in Paris attracted 270,000 fans over the course of the Ryder Cup Weekend -- an injection of $278 million to the French economy, according to a study by Sheffield Hallam University.

Fans pack the grandstand at Le Golf National in Paris to witness Team Europe's victory in 2018.

But even more lucrative are the global TV deals. ""TV doesn't want to house the event unless it's top class TV,"" Harrington explained.

""They don't want to host sporting events with shallow ratings, they want the good ratings so they knew they needed spectators.""

The knock-on impact of postponement

With its postponement, the Ryder Cup returns to its biennial spot in odd-numbered years.

From 1947 to 1999, this was its traditional spot in the calendar, but after the grounding of flights in the wake of 9/11, the 2001 Ryder Cup at The Belfry in England was postponed to the following year.

Since then the Ryder Cup has taken place in even-numbered years, with the Presidents Cup -- Team USA's alternate biennial match against a 'rest of the world apart from Europe' side -- taking place in the odd years.

For Pelley, the realignment of the traditional 'cup years' is one of the silver linings to the postponement.

""You can look at it and say, 'Oh, my word, that's incredibly detrimental to your business. How are you going to be able to survive financially?' But you can also look at it completely differently and go, 'Oh, it's a great positive. It gets us back onto the rotation that we always wanted with the odd years.'""

The move knocks the Presidents Cup back into even years, and also gives Europe an extra year to prepare the Marco Simone course in Rome for hosting the 2023 Ryder Cup.

The 2023 Ryder Cup at the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club will be the first time the tournament has been played in Italy.

""I'm not saying it wouldn't have been ready for 2022,"" Pelley explained. ""But one more year to get an Italian Open and for Marco Simone to mature as a golf course is a significant advantage for us.""

As for the captains -- and in turn the players -- one more year to wait could have a sizable impact on who gets selected for each team.

While some players seem nailed on for a spot in the tournament -- the likes of Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm for Team Europe and Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau for Team USA -- there are 12 places to fill for each team, and an extra year is sure to see some changes in who makes the cut.

From a European perspective, Harrington admits he already has his eye on some younger candidates for next September.

""It actually gives some time to some young kids to make the '21 team,"" he says. ""The Hojgaard twins, they're only 18, they were too young this year, but next year? Sam Horsfield is obviously coming to play.

Danish twin brothers Rasmus and Nicolai Hojgaard played together in the 2018 Junior Ryder Cup.

""It gives the younger players a chance to play their way in, which is obviously a little tough on the older guys because they're a year older. But things will change by 2021.""

It may prove vital for Team Europe that things do change. With eight of the world's current top 10 players coming from the US, Europe will have their work cut out if they are to claim victory on American soil.

While the 12-month grace period can't guarantee that fans will be able to attend the tournament at Whistling Straits, it at least facilitates the possibility -- and as all the organizers agree, a Ryder Cup is no Ryder Cup without fans.

""I think it was the right choice,"" Harrington concludes. ""Hopefully next year we'll be in a lot better place."""

During his campaign, Modi faced questions about India's mixed economic performance in the previous five years, but he won over voters with promises to shore up national security and by pushing a Hindu nationalist agenda.

In the past six months, he's faced two significant challenges: nationwide protests over a controversial citizenship law, which led to violent attacks on Muslims, and the threat of thousands of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic.

His handling of the latter has earned praised at home and abroad. But the biggest test is arguably to come -- reopening the country while keeping its 1.3 billion people safe.

Here are five things we've learned about the Indian leader during the past year.

Element of surprise: a Modi hallmark

At 8 p.m. on March 24, Modi gave just four hours' notice of a nationwide coronavirus lockdown , sending millions of people scrambling for groceries, medicines and other essentials.

Perhaps worst affected were the millions of migrant workers who travel from rural areas to work in cities each year. In the lockdown, work suddenly dried up, leaving many of them stranded without pay. Many were forced to walk vast distances due to the public transport shutdown -- and not all of them made it.

Modi's sudden decision -- accompanied by poor planning and execution -- left local administrations confused over what was and wasn't allowed, such as exemptions for online grocery deliveries amid the halt on all e-commerce operations.

""This is a part of his governing style and it can work during normal times but it's not a good way to operate in a time of crisis where you throw surprises at 1.3 billion people,"" said Vivek Dehejia, a professor of economics at Carleton University in Ottawa.

This, of course, was not the first time Modi has made a snap announcement. On November 8, 2016, Modi declared 500 rupee ($7.50) and 1,000 rupee ($15) notes worthless, which made up about 86% of the cash in circulation, in a bid to switch the country to digital payments to stop corruption and tax evasion.

""In each case, there was a four-hour window for people to react and absolute pandemonium broke out,"" said Dehejia.

The result was massive lines at banks, change was nearly impossible to find, and some businesses resorted to barter, with India's poor and most vulnerable bearing the biggest impact. People in remote places missed the window to exchange years' worth of savings in old currency notes.

""You need to think about the consequences and how this will impact millions of people,"" said Meghnad S, an associate editor for Newslaundry, an independent online news outlet.

Distracting from the economy

""Good days are coming,"" was Modi's campaign slogan, as he secured his first term in 2014 on the back of grand plans for the country's economy.

But the lacklustre figures had little bearing on the 2019 election results, which saw Modi return to power with a bigger mandate.

India's unemployment rate hit 8.75% in March, up from 7.03% in May last year -- and is even higher after the coronavirus shutdown.

Furthermore, during his term, his government has committed funds to vanity projects, such as the world's tallest statue or bullet trains , when priorities such as healthcare, infrastructure and sanitation persist.

And with the economic destruction wreaked by the pandemic things are unlikely to improve.

As the country nears the end of a near 10-week lockdown, as of Friday, India had more than 165,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 4,700 deaths.

A senior citizen watches Modi address the nation on a television broadcast during India's government-imposed coronavirus lockdown.

In his last national address on May 12, Modi announced an additional financial package to help the economy.

The new stimulus package, along with previous measures taken by the Indian government, would account for about $266 billion, which is around 10% of the country's GDP, according to Modi.

His government later said this would include $40 billion to help small businesses affected by the outbreak, $20 billion to strengthen the agricultural industry and $5 billion for migrant workers and small-scale farmers.

Furthemore, for many Modi's demonetization strategy built a narrative that he is a strongman who took on black money, and therefore has taken successful economic action.

""Despite the amount of pain caused, a lot of people still love the fact he did something like that,"" says Vivek Kaul, an economic commentator and author. ""If the idea was to get black money out, there are lots of ways to do that, but that would have involved a lot of work.""

Promoting Brand India

Modi is renowned as a master of public relations.

He's become known for his bear hug-embraces of world leaders, while his slogan ""Make in India"" signaled his intention to rebrand the country as the world's next manufacturing hub. In February, he packed the world's largest cricket stadium for a rousing welcome rally for the US President Donald Trump, taglined ""Namaste Trump.""

Modi's flair for PR has been evident during the pandemic, with India promoting its role as a global leader in pharmaceuticals.

A number of world leaders lined up to thank India for its work supplying generic drugs like hydroxychloroquine to meet a rise in demand during the pandemic -- including President Trump.

""Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten!"" Trump tweeted.

Modi responded : ""Times like these bring friends closer. The India-US partnership is stronger than ever ... We shall win this together."" Medical journal The Lancet has since reported that Covid-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine are more likely to die or develop dangerous irregular heart rhythms.

Modi also heavily promoted the country's decision to fly 20,000 citizens home from foreign countries during the pandemic. According to Meghnad, from Newslaundry, it was an example of Modi's external PR efforts to present India's success to the world -- internal migrants' troubles during the lockdown received much less attention.

Dehejia believes there is ""a huge cognitive gap between the rhetoric and the reality"" of Modi's vision of India as a growing economy and an important player in international affairs, after recent events dented the country's soft power and image as a vibrant democracy.

""This was well before the (coronavirus) crisis when anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protests were taking off. That was not good for India's brand as a liberal democracy. The migrant crisis has further damaged the brand,"" says Dehejia.

Marginalizing Muslims

Modi has not been shy about his pro-Hindu religious policies and has lived up to pledges made on the campaign trail.

Last August, he made the surprise decision to scrap a constitutional provision that granted Jammu and Kashmir relative autonomy, which sent the region into turmoil and saw tens of thousands of new troops deployed.

Then in November, his government granted Hindus permission to build a temple at the centuries-old Ayodhya holy site, previously claimed by Hindus and Muslims. The next month, India passed a bill to give Indian citizenship to immigrants from three neighboring countries -- but not if they are Muslim.

Activists stage a candlelight vigil ahead of the Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhyas Ram Janmabhoomi case, in Bangalore on November 7, 2019.

The pandemic has provided more opportunity to marginalize Muslims, after a March gathering in New Delhi of the Tablighi Jamaat, a conservative Muslim missionary group, resulted in a large cluster of cases.

Reports of Islamophobic attacks, both online and on the streets, began to surface, with Muslims being accused of spreading the virus.

Some members of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) began comparing the incident to terrorism.

On Twitter, the head of the BJP's information and technology unit, Amit Malviya, called the gathering part of an ""Islamic insurrection"" while Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the BJP's Minister for Minority Affairs accused the event organizers of a ""Talibani crime.""

Like previous incidents, most recently seen in February when violent communal clashes broke out in the capital New Delhi, the government failed to take stringent action.

""Modi did put out a tweet on harmony but it felt like an afterthought. There's a lack of communication and it's more obvious because otherwise he tweets about everything under the sun,"" said Meghnad, from Newslaundry.

""Obviously, they (Tablighi Jamaat) are at fault and action should be taken but to paint an entire community and the conflation of the actions of a few is ridiculous. The government should actively come out but they let it turn into the monster that it did,"" he added.

Priorities on spending

While Modi's government has announced $266 billion in relief packages during the pandemic, Dehejia, from Carleton University, points out that much of what was announced in a week-long series of press conferences by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had already been committed.

""Part of the Modi government brand has been to make these big announcements over things that they've already been doing or what previous governments have done and brand it as a new package ... The amount of new money committed is essentially quite small,"" he said.

Sitharaman's penultimate press conference highlighting reforms to sectors such as mining, defense and the country's space program raised eyebrows over the relevance of the announcement during the current situation.

""Tone-deaf is the only charitable explanation,"" said Dehejia. Many felt more should have been invested in the country's creaking healthcare infrastructure, which has been an issue regardless of the party in power.

According to the World Bank, in 2017, India allocated around 3.5% of its GDP towards health. This compares to the United States, which spent 17% of its GDP on healthcare and poorer nations such as Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, which set aside 13.4% and 12% respectively in the same year.

Looking ahead, spending wisely and investing in the right parts of the economy will be crucial -- though experts say Modi has such a strong mandate that he's essentially free to do what he wants.

And India's next election isn't due until 2024.

The bigger issue is the lack of credible opposition. The 2019 election dealt a sharp blow to the India's main opposition Congress party, which won just 52 seats compared to the BJP's 303. To win, a party needs 272 elected seats out of 543.

The result marked the Congress party's second-worst showing ever in a general election.

""A crisis of any kind greatly empowers the incumbent. Whether it's Trump's nightly news conferences or Boris Johnson's or Modi's announcements, that's what's visible to the public and opposition parties struggle to make an impact or appear on the evening news,"" said Dehejia.

""What is the credible alternative at the national level? Modi's the only game in town for India."""
Tokyo transformed: Global sporting events put spotlight on Japan's capital,,"(CNN) — With Tokyo set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events -- the Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics -- Japan's capital is making final preparations for the global spotlight.

So what will sports fans notice when they travel here?

First of all, they won't be alone.

Tourism in Tokyo is already booming. Annual foreign visitor arrivals to Japan trebled in the years from 2013 to 2018 to over 31 million, with around 10 million stopping in Tokyo. That's supposed to top 40 million in 2020.

However, unlike other destinations in Japan that are visibly struggling to cope with the influx, Tokyo, thanks to its size and a series of measures to prepare for the deluge, has so far been able to absorb them.

Rugby World Cup kicks off this week

The city's Olympic readiness will get a test run when the Rugby World Cup kicks off on September 20 at Tokyo Stadium. Matches will be held in 12 Japanese cities and around 600,000 international rugby fans are expected to descend on the country, taking one third of tickets.

Most of those will be from rugby heartlands: the British Isles, France, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The organizers have promised that all the basics for an exciting and welcoming experience are in place, with 13,000 volunteers, many with English-language skills, on hand on match days.

Tokyo Stadium itself is around 18 kilometers to the west of what can be considered the central part of the city, though there are two official fan zones at the Tokyo Sports Square and Chofu Station Square/Chofu City Green Hall.

Unless Japan is playing, local pubs, known as izakayas, are more likely to be watching the culmination of the baseball season or variety shows on TV than rugby.

This is where some businesses are looking to fill the gap, such as the Hub group of British-style pubs and ANA Intercontinental Hotel Group.

Both are making efforts to target foreign visitors and local sports fans with promotions and fan-theme areas in their bars and hotels to watch live broadcasts of the matches.

""What I most expect is that we will have many foreigners who understand pub culture (because it's originally their culture) and they enjoy chatting and watching sports,"" says Tsuyoshi Ota, president of Hub.

While the sport is growing in the country and Japan's national team, known as ""The Brave Blossoms"" notched a huge win in the tournament against South African four years ago, it still remains niche.

""I think locals will find something big is going on in September seeing so many foreigners and they will give foreigners a warm greeting. I don't think most local people realize that so many people are coming to Japan for the Rugby World Cup,"" says Ota.

Tokoyite and sports fan Kensuke Tezuka also thinks that once the event gets going the atmosphere and local interest level will change.

""Japanese people tend to be quiet in daily life but we get cheerful and friendly in omatsuri (festival) occasions. I remember the 2002 football World Cup. Shibuya Crossing was very lively. The visitors come to Tokyo for a once-in a-lifetime occasion, so they are naturally excited. They will provide a great vibe.""

The 'Olympics effect'

l e v a r t

Japan's government expects the ""Olympics effect"" will bring approximately an extra 10 million visitors to the country in 2020.

It's an opportunity to showcase Tokyo to the world and the country isn't taking it lightly. Earlier this year, the city's governor, Yuriko Koike, told media the city was poised for ""dramatic change.""

""This year, 2019, will be key in making those Games a success and ushering in a new Tokyo,"" said Koike.

Major developments now underway include the Takanawa Gateway -- the first new station build on Tokyo's key JR Yamanote train line since 1971 -- which is due to open next year.

Featuring a steel-and-glass roof inspired by traditional Japanese origami, it's located between Tamachi and Shinagawa Stations and was designed by architect Kengo Kuma, who is also behind the new National Stadium being built for the 2020 Tokyo Games.

The area around Shibuya Station is also being revamped as part of a huge multi-year makeover to cement it as the city's entertainment, transport and business hub for decades to come.

This includes the new Shibuya Scramble Square, a 230-meter high mixed-use skyscraper located directly above Shibuya Station, with indoor and outdoor observation decks. It's due to open for business November 1.

Another hotly anticipated opening in this neighborhood is the Meiji Jingu Museum -- also by Kengo Kuma. Due to open in late October, it sits next to Yoyogi Park and is designed to blend into its wooded surroundings while showcasing important cultural artifacts.

Other changes of note include wider free wifi coverage not just in Tokyo but in the entire country -- including 108 Shinkansen ""bullet train"" stations.

To assist with language barriers while dining, the Tokyo government has launched a special location-based website that highlights restaurants with multilingual menus.

New Olympics sporting venues

In terms of Olympic sporting action, 30 events will be taking place at 43 venues, with the soon-to-be-finished New National Stadium as the centerpiece.

Located on the site of the main stadium for the 1964 Olympics, it's just a few kilometers from areas of the city popular with foreign visitors such as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza and Roppongi.

On top of that, 10 public locations including Yoyogi and Hibiya parks will broadcast events, while a cohort of 80,000 volunteers -- many of them English-speaking -- will guide visitors, meaning the city should be well prepared.

Visiting sports fans with tickets will also find themselves near Tokyo Bay. It's not a traditional tourist area, but one developed for the Olympics and Paralympics.

It will host 17 sporting venues and the Olympic Village, where humanoid robots will reportedly be available to offer directions to nearby accommodations and attractions.

Book those hotel rooms now

According to real estate services company CBRE, an additional 30,000 hotel rooms are predicted to be available in Tokyo by 2020, compared to 2017, bringing the total to around 120,000.

Among the most anticipated is the Okura Tokyo, which has just reopened following extensive renovations that kicked off in 2015.

The original Hotel Okura Tokyo main building opened in 1962 and quickly became a global favorite by offering a mix of traditional Japanese culture with world-class service. After four years of rebuilding work, it has reopened as the Okura Tokyo and offers 508 luxury rooms in two buildings.

However, many more rooms are expected to be needed to cope with the influx of Olympic visitors.

Stricter requirements on locals looking rent spare rooms in their homes, through sites such as Airbnb, and few budget hotel options in the city means that planning and booking as far in advance as possible is strongly advised.

Other stresses are predicted, both for visitors and locals.

While most signage in stations and on public transport in the capital is already in Japanese and English, the influx will put more pressure on the city's infrastructure, particularly the full-to-bursting Metro and other train lines, which visitors will be using just like the city's commuters.

But counter measures are being planned so Olympic spectators and 'salary men' and 'office ladies' don't make each other's journey even more of a squeeze.

For instance, one initiative underway is encouraging businesses to allow shift- and tele-working by its employees -- a concept still hard to digest in Japan's rigid work culture where employees works some of the longest hours in the world.

""No need to worry""

Regardless of the potential disruptions, many, like taxi driver Masaru Okano, are looking forward to Tokyo hosting these huge events and the longer-term changes to Tokyo that are expected.

The 69-year-old has been learning English, and some Korean, for the last few years to provide a better service to the growing number of foreign visitors he finds in his cab.

""When I give them a ride, I always ask where they came from and I try to greet them in their language,"" he says."
